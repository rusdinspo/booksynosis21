Featuring Austin's intimate images--some as detailed as a single haunting eye--that result from encounters based on mutual trust, <i>Beautiful Whale</i> captures the grace and intelligence of these magnificent creatures. Austin spent days at a time submerged, motionless, in the waters of remote calving grounds waiting for humpback, sperm, and minke whales to seek him out. As oceanographer Sylvia A. Earle says in her foreword to the book, "As an ambassador from the ocean--and to the ocean--Bryant Austin is not only a source of inspiration. He is cause for hope."</p><p><b>Bryant Austin</b> is a fine art photographer whose work has exhibited internationally including countries such as Norway, Japan, Spain, Chile, UK, and the United States.

Compiled after the horrors of World War II, its purpose was to state and protect the rights of all people. This beautiful commemorative edition celebrates each declaration with an illustration by an internationally renowned artist or illustrator, including Jackie Morris, Satoshi Kitamura, Catherine Anholt and Laurence Anholt, Marie-Louise Gay, Jessica Souhami, Peter Sis, Mick Manning and Brita Granstr�m, Hong Song-Dam, and many others. A testament to freedom and the human spirit, it is a thoughtful gift for children and adults alike. With a foreword by John Boyne, author of <i>The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,</i> and <i>Doctor Who&#x2019;s</i> David Tennant, <i>We Are All Born Free</i> is published in association with Amnesty International, and all royalties will be donated to the organization.</p><p>Amnesty International is a worldwide movement of people who campaign for internationally recognized human rights. AI has a varied network of members and supporters around the world. At the latest count, there were more than 2.2 million members, supporters and subscribers in over 150 countries and territories in every region of the world. Although they come from many different backgrounds and have widely different political and religious beliefs, they are united by a determination to work for a world where everyone enjoys human rights.Grade 2&#x2013;6&#x2014;Proclaimed by the United Nations on December 10, 1948, these rights apply to every child and adult throughout the world. Amnesty International has taken the 30 articles that comprise the Declaration and simplified them in such a way that they are clear to elementary school students. Each right is illustrated by an international array of well-known artists. Some of the pictures are downright cozy, such as Bob Graham's peacefully sleeping child surrounded by toys for Article 12, "Nobody should try to harm our good name." It is followed by Alan Lee's somber pen-and-ink drawing of folded paper cranes that have come to grief on a barbed-wire fence. The text of Article 13 reads: "We all have the right to go where we want in our own country and to travel abroad as we wish." Other artistic interpretations are provided by John Burningham, Niki Daly, Polly Dunbar, Jessica Souhami, and Satoshi Kitamura. This is an important book, best shared with children in a setting where discussion of both the rights and the illustrations is encouraged.&#x2014;<i>Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Keiko's unique approach combines traditional techniques with modern tastes, incorporating influences ranging from sculpture to today's Western styles. The result is a one-of-a-kind look that is authentic, easy to create and attractive.<br><br>The book includes easy-to-follow instructions for creating 20 stunning ikebana arrangements to help readers bring this traditional Japanese art into their own homes. Readers will also be introduced to the history of ikebana, including its evolution from ancient times into the world of modern design, the basic 'rules' of ikebana design and suggestions for finding and choosing materials and supplies.</p><p><i><b>Keiko Kubo</b></i> has studied ikebana for many years and is certified to teach ikebana in Japan. She is a careful observer of nature and incorporates and highlights natural beauty in her simple, stylish arrangements. Currently she lives in Chicago, IL.Kubo brings her skills as a sculptor, certified ikebana instructor and student of Western floral design to this introduction to the traditional Japanese art form, which includes directions for 20 arrangements. The author describes her approach to ikebana as a freestyle mix of classical principles and contemporary Western design. By playing with three main elements (line, volume and accent), Kubo says, even beginners can create a wide variety of designs that bring out the inherent beauty of flowers, leaves, branches and other natural materials. She provides a concise history of ikebana, dating to the sixth-century custom of offering flowers to Buddha; explains styles that have developed up to the present day; and discusses ikebana's close ties to Japanese architecture and culture. Kubo also gives brief but thorough descriptions of the tools and techniques readers will need to master, as well as a list of resources for supplies. Kubo's respectful but eclectic take on tradition is refreshing. Novice practitioners will likely welcome her less-is-more philosophy, in which a minimum of materials are transformed into satisfying art forms. Beautifully illustrated with color photographs by Erich Schrempp, the book is an elegant reminder of nature's subtle ability to nurture the human spirit.<i> (Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bruce Franklin shows how menhaden have shaped America&#x2019;s national&#x2014;and natural&#x2014;history, and why reckless overfishing now threatens their place in both. Since Native Americans began using menhaden as fertilizer, this amazing fish has greased the wheels of U.S. agriculture and industry. By the mid-1870s, menhaden had replaced whales as a principal source of industrial lubricant, with hundreds of ships and dozens of factories along the eastern seaboard working feverishly to produce fish oil. Since the Civil War, menhaden have provided the largest catch of any American fishery. Today, one company&#x2014;Omega Protein&#x2014;has a monopoly on the menhaden &#x201c;reduction industry.&#x201d; Every year it sweeps billions of fish from the sea, grinds them up, and turns them into animal feed, fertilizer, and oil used in everything from linoleum to health-food supplements.&nbsp;The massive harvest wouldn&#x2019;t be such a problem if menhaden were only good for making lipstick and soap. But they are crucial to the diet of bigger fish and they filter the waters of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, playing an essential dual role in marine ecology perhaps unmatched anywhere on the planet. As their numbers have plummeted, fish and birds dependent on them have been decimatedand toxic algae have begun to choke our bays and seas. In Franklin&#x2019;s vibrant prose, the decline of a once ubiquitous fish becomes an adventure story, an exploration of the U.S. political economy, a groundbreaking history of America&#x2019;s emerging ecological consciousness, and an inspiring vision of a growing alliance between environmentalists and recreational anglers.</p><p><p>H. Bruce Franklin is the John Cotton Dana Professor of English and American Studies at Rutgers University-Newark. He has authored or edited eighteen books, including War Stars: The Superweapon and the American Imagination, M.I.A. or Mythmaking in America, Prison Writing in Twentieth-Century America, and Vietnam and Other American Fantasies. Franklin has lectured widely and his hundreds of articles and reviews have appeared in publications including The Atlantic Monthly, The New York Times, Science, The Nation, and Discover. </p><p></p><p></p>Reviewed by Susan P. Williams<p>In 1997, Mark Kurlansky published a history of cod that was engaging, brief and, ultimately, award-winning. H. Bruce Franklin's book about menhaden, The Most Important Fish in the Sea, invites comparison. Kurlansky's charming book focused mostly on the human communities whose diet and economies depended on that fish. Franklin, however, concentrates on marine communities -- specifically, what eats menhaden and what menhaden eat. Humans are not eating menhaden, which Franklin calls "oily, foul smelling,</p><p>and packed with tiny bones." But we do eat the cod, weakfish and halibut -- just about any Atlantic saltwater food fish -- that eat menhaden. (If the name "menhaden," pronounced men-heyd-in, seems odd, consider the other appellations given to this fish over the years: masbank, marsbanker, mossbunker and bunker.) Franklin calls menhaden "the most important fish in the sea" because of what they themselves eat: algae. The same algae that</p><p>flourish in the runoff from paved roads and fertilized lawns. The same algae that, overflourishing, become a bloom of red or brown tide. </p><p> The deadly chain continues: Red tides kill massive numbers of fish, the fish sink to the bottom, the plants that exhale oxygen and the shellfish that eat algae are smothered, dissolved oxygen is sucked from the water by the ensuing decomposition, and underwater dead zones grow. Algae blooms are increasing, partly because menhaden are declining. But since we don't eat menhaden, where are they going? Into linoleum, soap, paint and dog food. The oil from menhaden becomes lubricants and their dried carcasses become feed.</p><p>The industry that converts menhaden into these products supports a fleet of ships and spotter planes, mostly owned by one company, Omega Protein, that capture billions of these fish each year. Their only natural defense against predators -- swimming in dense schools -- makes them more vulnerable to the boats that surround them with huge nets. The toll on menhaden, then, comes from overfishing.</p><p>Where Kurlansky drew upon his experience working on commercial fishing boats, Franklin, a professor of English and American studies at Rutgers University in Newark, had no such springboard -- just a summer's day fishing. Early one morning in 1999, Franklin and three other men set out in a 19-foot boat from Keyport, N.J., to catch weakfish on Matawan Creek. The Matawan is a major nursery for juvenile menhaden, and Franklin and his companions soon saw a swarm of birds feeding on bits of menhaden left by ravaging bluefish. Before long, a spotter plane materialized and a seiner followed, scooping up an entire school of menhaden. That spot on the Matawan was devoid of menhaden, as well as bluefish and weakfish, for many days afterward.</p><p> Franklin, who has also written books about the Vietnam War and weapons systems, notes: "I had no prior interest in menhaden and almost no knowledge about their history or the issues surrounding them. But this incident of minor strip mining was disturbing enough to push me onto the long trail that eventually led to this book." He makes an exhaustive examination of issues, including class conflicts among commercial fishermen, fish-factory workers and recreational anglers; the government's role in setting catch limits as well as assisting the menhaden processing industry; and how yearly catch calculations are especially misleading for menhaden.</p><p> Franklin lays blame where he thinks it belongs: "All but two of the fifteen states [making up the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission] have recognized the disastrous consequences of the wholesale slaughter of menhaden and therefore have banished the reduction industry from their waters. This has left Virginia and North Carolina as the only states benighted enough, or still sufficiently under the control of the industry, to allow this assault on their environment. One result has been to turn the Virginia waters of the Chesapeake into . . . the last vortex swallowing great portions of the remaining schools of Atlantic menhaden. These waters have therefore become a battle zone where the fate of both the species and the bay may be decided."</p><p>But Franklin does more than spout statistics and quote authoritative experts. He guides us on a journey through history, explaining how we got to this point. And "we" really means "we": people who live in Maryland, Washington and Virginia. Menhaden were the fish that Native Americans taught the Pilgrims to use as fertilizer for their corn. And today the Chesapeake Bay -- once "the world's capital of striped bass, bluefish, weakfish, croakers, blue crabs, and, of course, menhaden" -- is suffering from expanding dead zones. Franklin's prose is lucid and infused with an urgency that depends little on hyperbole and largely on careful documentation. His compelling narrative informs and enlightens.</p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

Several novels are the basis of a television miniseries. He was born in London and lives in Chatham, Massachusetts.In the eighth volume in this superb series on the Napoleonic Wars (Sharpe's Siege, Audio Reviews, LJ 11/1/96), Sharpe must return from Spain to London to investigate why his supply of recruits has dried up. It's 1813, and Sharpe discovers a corrupt political enemy has diverted his recruits to sell them at auction. When he gets close to the source, the ring leaders try to kill him. Sharpe risks charges of treason to expose corruption at the highest level. The novel exposes the recruiting practices that, in fact, scandalized England and brought down prominent royal advisors. As usual, past and present sweethearts try to save Sharpe when danger threatens. Narrator-supreme Frederick Davidson provides the flavor of British life in the early 19th century on the lowest and highest levels as well as battlefield excitement as British troops cross into France from Spain.

But the architectural achievements in this guide are so charming and sometimes so elaborate that it's hard to imagine actually eating them; they're meant to be admired, not devoured. From rustic to royal, humble to ornate, this eclectic assortment ranges from cooking-school complex to child-simple. Some were even designed by kids and could certainly be constructed by them. (Just be sure to buy extra trimmings, since the budding architects are bound to do some nibbling!)<p> The authors lay solid groundwork in the introductory section, explaining the key points of gingerbread building, pattern making, and utilizing various types of trimmings, and offer basic recipes for gingerbread dough, royal icing, marzipan, pastillage, and fondant. Then it's on to the structures themselves, contributed by more than four dozen designers. Houses, cabins, inns, chapels, castles, lighthouses, even whole little villages drip with snowy icing, as candies, cookies, and other goodies mimic stone, brick, shingle, stucco, logs, and landscaping. This is not a step-by-step guide but rather a gallery of wonderful ideas, with photos of each creation and some very general suggestions about making them. The photography is not high quality but is adequate enough to show detail, and templates are included for many of the structures. One designer even found an ingenious solution to the edibility dilemma, turning the flat roof of her elaborate Victorian concoction into a serving surface for Christmas cookies. <i>--Amy Handy</i></p></p><h2>When the Killing&#39;s Done: A Novel</h2><p><b>From the bestselling author of <i>The Women</i> comes an action- packed adventure about endangered animals and those who protect them. </b> <br><br> Principally set on the wild and sparsely inhabited Channel Islands off the coast of Santa Barbara, T.C. Boyle's powerful new novel combines pulse-pounding adventure with a socially conscious, richly humane tale regarding the dominion we attempt to exert, for better or worse, over the natural world. Alma Boyd Takesue is a National Park Service biologist who is spearheading the efforts to save the island's endangered native creatures from invasive species like rats and feral pigs, which, in her view, must be eliminated. Her antagonist, Dave LaJoy, is a dreadlocked local businessman who, along with his lover, the folksinger Anise Reed, is fiercely opposed to the killing of any species whatsoever and will go to any lengths to subvert the plans of Alma and her colleagues. <br><br> Their confrontation plays out in a series of escalating scenes in which these characters violently confront one another, and tempt the awesome destructive power of nature itself. Boyle deepens his story by going back in time to relate the harrowing tale of Alma's grandmother Beverly, who was the sole survivor of a 1946 shipwreck in the channel, as well as the tragic story of Anise's mother, Rita, who in the late 1970s lived and worked on a sheep ranch on Santa Cruz Island. In dramatizing this collision between protectors of the environment and animal rights' activists, Boyle is, in his characteristic fashion, examining one of the essential questions of our time: Who has the right of possession of the land, the waters, the very lives of all the creatures who share this planet with us? <i>When the Killing's Done</i> will offer no transparent answers, but like <i>The Tortilla Curtain</i>, Boyle's classic take on illegal immigration, it will touch you deeply and put you in a position to decide.</p><p>T. C. Boyle is the author of eleven novels, including <b>World's End</b> (winner of the PEN/FaulknerAward), <b>Drop City</b> (a <b>New York Times</b> bestseller and finalist for the National Book Award), and <b>The Inner Circle</b>. His most recent story collections are <b>Tooth and Claw</b> and <b>The Human Fly and Other Stories</b>. <p> </p>*Starred Review* Boyle&#x2019;s great subject is humankind&#x2019;s blundering relationship with the rest of the living world. In his thirteenth novel, he transports us to California&#x2019;s Galapagos, the surprisingly wild Northern Channel Islands off the coast of Santa Barbara. There a stormy, cliff-hanging tale of foolhardy and treacherous journeys unfolds, anchored to the tough women in two indomitable matriarchal lines. A 1946 pleasure cruise gone wrong shipwrecks Beverly on the island of Anacapa. Decades later, her ambitious biologist granddaughter, Alma, oversees the National Park Service&#x2019;s hubristic efforts to rid Anacapa, and neighboring Santa Cruz Island, of invasive animal species in organized killing sprees. Dreadlocked businessman Dave LaJoy, a man of rage and aberrance, along with his lover, Anise, the last child raised on Santa Cruz, where her mother worked on a doomed sheep ranch, incites reckless protests with chain-reaction consequences. Incisive and caustically witty, Boyle is fluent in evolutionary biology and island biogeography, cognizant of the shared emotions of all sentient beings, in awe over nature&#x2019;s crushing power, and, by turns, bemused and appalled by human perversity. Boyle brings all these powers and concerns to bear as he creates magnetic characters and high suspense, culminating in a piercing vision of our needy, confused, and destructive species thrashing about in the great web of life. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Famous for his avidly attended public appearances, Boyle has seen his readership multiply following the huge success of The Women (2009). --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Hit Me (A John Keller Novel, 5)</h2><p>The conclusion of Hit and Run found Keller living in a big old house in post-Katrina New Orleans&#39; Lower Garden District, with a new name (Nicholas Edwards), a new wife (Julia), a new career (rehabbing houses), and a baby on the way. It certainly looked as though he was done killing people for money. But old habits die hard, and when the economic downturn knocked out the construction business, a phone call from Dot draws him back into the old game. His work takes him to Dallas, to settle a domestic dispute; to Florida, where he joins a government witness on a West Indies cruise; to Wyoming, where a widow has her husband&#39;s stamp collection for sale; and to New York, where he lived for so many years, and where people might remember him.</p><p>Lawrence Block is a Mystery Writers of America Grand Master, has won multiple Edgar and Shamus awards and countless international prizes.

And with his forceful, angry book he establishes himself as a "patient advocate," for during his own recent medical treatment, rheumatologist Rosenbaum "learned more about handling the seriously ill . . . than in 50 years of practice." His comment gives the reader pause: not only is the author a physician, his Portland, Ore., group practice includes two sons and his brother (another son and two daughters-in-law are also doctors). Rosenbaum, stricken with cancer of the larynx, kept a journal during his therapyand reading it, one wonders if sheer cussedness alone caused his cancer to go into remission. He records his threats to bring a malpractice suit against the doctors who misdiagnosed his affliction for nine months, rails against the indifference of those administering his X-ray treatments, expresses his resentment at his radiologist's lack of compassion. Rosenbaum has strong opinions as well about medicine's turn toward big-business techniques, the profit motive, cost-effectiveness; criticizes insurance carriers, Medicare and Medicaid. His rancor will be a bitter pill to the brethren. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement</h2><p>On Wall Street, in the culture of high tech, in American government: Libertarianism&#x2014;the simple but radical idea that the only purpose of government is to protect its citizens and their property against direct violence and threat&#x2014; has become an extremely influential strain of thought. But while many books talk about libertarian ideas, none until now has explored the history of this uniquely American movement&#x2014;where and who it came from, how it evolved, and what impact it has had on our country.<p> In this revelatory book, based on original research and interviews with more than 100 key sources, Brian Doherty traces the evolution of the movement through the unconventional life stories of its most influential leaders&#x2014; Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek, Ayn Rand, Murray Rothbard, and Milton Friedman&#x2014;and through the personal battles, character flaws, love affairs, and historical events that altered its course. And by doing so, he provides a fascinating new perspective on American history&#x2014;from the New Deal through the culture wars of the 1960s to today's most divisive political issues. Neither an expos� nor a political polemic, this entertaining historical narrative will enlighten anyone interested in American politics.</p></p><p><b>Brian Doherty</b> is a senior editor at <i>Reason</i> magazine.

This remarkable, eclectic gathering of ten years' work offers poems of remembrance and renewal, celebrating life's complexities from the domestic to the eternal. As husband and father, son and citizen, the poet explores with clear sureness his "membership" in his community and in the world.<br>The heart of this collection is a sequence of poems written during Berry's father's final years. From conflict, grief, great loss and great love, there emerges a compassion and understanding: in death and in memory begins immortality.</p><p>Berry's first collection since 1987 reads like a compilation taken from the years since, including occasional pieces, political satire and what seem like sketches. The influences are as diverse as Blake, Williams, and the later Yeats ("He served with mind and hand / What we were hoping for: / The small house on the land, / The shade tree by the door"). Berry's poems are united less by an aesthetic than an ethic, composed of respect for the earth and its people and a conviction that one must speak out against whatever forces stand in opposition: "The spool of our engine-driven fate / unwinds, our history now outspeeding / thought, and the heart is a beatable tool." The poetry's general lack of metaphor leads to some drily rhetorical writing: "It is the stewardship / of its own possibility, / the past remembering itself / in the presence of / the present, the power, learned / and handed down, to see / what is present." Yet Berry's observations (here, of a thunderstorm) can be acute: "Out our window we glimpsed the world / birthwet and shining, as even / the sun at noon had never made it shine." The last section of poems about his father is most powerful. One appreciates that Berry's writing about aging is not designed to comfort, but only to tell the truth about the last stage of his father's life, "when immortal love / In flesh, denying time, will look / At what is lost, and grief fulfill / The budget of desire. Sometimes, / At home, he longs to be at home." <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.There is probably no more conservative American man of letters today than Wendell Berry. He is not the political type of conservative, though we might wish political conservatives were more of his kind--i.e., those who uphold human community as the basis for healthy and moral families and persons rather than those who, in the name of free trade and individual liberties, encourage that community be subordinated to progress and profit. In his prose (most recently, in <i>Sex, Economy, Freedom &amp; Community</i> [1993]), Berry brilliantly expounds the thought behind his devotion to community; in his poems, however, of which these are wonderfully typical, he celebrates the family and the community he knows best--his own farming clan and neighbors--in simple diction and the iambic rhythm so natural to English. They are conservative poems--elegies, meditations, love lyrics, satires (a whole section of them!)--and now that their author's reaching senior-poet status, they often sound as wise and alternately modest and playful as late Robert Frost, whose mantle Berry's more qualified than most to don. <i>Ray Olson</i></p><h2>John of God: Loco in Granada</h2><p>Soiling to fore-edge and top-edge of book, internally clean.

Holway has produced the most authoritative work yet on the subject of the Negro Leagues.</p><p>Imagine the "major leagues" without Sammy Sosa, Ken Griffey, Jr., Pedro Martinez, and Derek Jeter. That's the "major leagues" that our great great grandfathers knew without Josh Gibson, Satchel Paige, Oscar Charleston, Smoky Joe Williams, and all the other black greats before Jackie Robinson. In hundreds of reported (barnstorming) games against the best white players before baseball became integrated in 1947, these black major leagues won 53 percent. <p>The Complete Book of Baseball's Negro Leagues is the most ambitious book ever undertaken on "the other half of baseball history." For the first time, almost every man who ever batted or pitched from 1862 to 1948 is listed, along with his annual batting average or won-lost record. It will change forever the way American baseball history is perceived and written. </p><p>This book is the result of thousands of man-hours, both paid and volunteer, to ferret out and extract data from over 14,000 box scores. Almost every black paper published between was scoured, plus every white daily in cities with a Negro League team, and papers in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Mexico. </p><p>The results have dispelled many long-held myths: Satchel Paige did not pitch in 3,000 games not win 1,000 of them...Josh Gibson did not hit 75 home runs in one years or 962 in a lifetime. (However, Josh would have hit 1,000 if he had come to bat as often as Hank Aaron). </p><p>It has also give recognition to many long-overlooked stars of North American baseball. Bill Foster, not Paige, is the all-time leader in victories; John Beckwith and Jud Wilson are the all-time leaders in batting averages. </p><p>The Complete Book of Baseball's Negro Leagues includes for the first time Latin American League games, where the rivalries forged in North America in the summer were continued with equal intensity in the winter. </p><p>In these pages fans can read for the first time of Mule Suttles' mammoth home run to win the 1933 East-West (All Star) game in the 11th inning, the prodigious home run paces of Suttles and Gibson that threatened to topple Ruth's 60-home run record a decade after it was set, of Rube Foster's heroics in the first black World Series of 1903 and Josh Gibson's mammoth Yankee Stadium home run in the black World Series in 1930. </p><p>The book includes details of every playoff and black World Series game, which were just as exciting as the gabled games of the white World Series. Is there anything in white history to equal the duel in the snow between Big Bill Foster and little Bullet Joe Rogan to settle the 1927 playoff - a duel won by Foster 1-0 and 5-0? The 1939 playoff battle between two future Hall of Fame catchers, the veteran Josh Gibson and the rookie Roy Campanella in a Series won by Campy's team? Or the moment in the 1942 black Series when Paige deliberately walked the bases loaded to pitch to Josh Gibson - then struck hom out? Had these happened in an integrated league, they would have dwarfed even the legend of Babe Ruth pointing to the bleachers, then slugging a homer in the 1932 white Series. </p><p>Perhaps most eye-opening are the dozens of box scores between Negro League stars and stars of the major white leagues. The blacks won 53 percent of these games, and black hitters batted the same against top white rivals in October as they ahd against the best black players from May to September. These include epic battles between Walter Johnson and Smoky Joe Williams (Joe won 1-0)..between Ty Cobb and John Henry Lloyd (Lloyd won .500 to .369)..between Babe Ruth and Cristobel Torriente (the Cuban won, three home runs to none). </p><p>We also learn of the off-the-field heroes, such as pitcher Doc Sykes, who was in the center of the notorious trial of "the Scottsboro Nine," one of the greatest civil rights dramas of the twentieth century and Monarchs coach J.L. Wilkinson, who in the 1940s was forced to sit and watch while major league scouts raided his teams, with no intention of ever paying him. </p><p>In these pages the reader will find some of the most exciting baseball played in North America. Here is a whole new world waiting to be discovered by fans of all colors, young and old.</p>John B.

Traffic hurried by in the late spring rain. People scurried with and without umbrellas down Lawrence Avenue. There were only three customers in the dinner; two of them were Korean businessmen who owned shops in the area, one a cleaning store, the other a show store. They were sitting in a booth finishing a later breakfast and arguing in Korean about something. The only other customer, a burly, weary-looking white man, sat in the booth behind them drinking coffee from a white mug and reading the <i>Sun-Times</i>.<br>The old counterman in a white apron filled white ceramic containers with packets of Sweet'n Low, Equal, and sugar. When the diner door opened, letting in the sound and smell of falling rain, the counterman barely looked up. The burly man shipped his coffee and turned to the sports pages in back. But the two Korean businessmen turned, rose from their unfinished breakfast and hurried to the counter to pay. One of them placed a ten-dollar bill near the cash register. The other businessman, the one with the shoe store, tried not to look at the trio who had come into the restaurant, one of whom was now closing the door behind him.<br>"I'll add it up," said the counterman, putting aside his packet container and wiping his hands on his apron.<br>"No need," said the cleaning store operator. "You keep change."<br>"Suit yourself," said the counterman with a shrug and reached for the ten spot while the businessmen made their way around the three men who had just entered.<br>The three were in their twenties, Korean. Two were dressed in the black jeans, nicely laundered white button-down shirts, and identical leather bomber jackets. The third Korean was slightly older than the other two and wore a black London Fog raincoat and sunglasses. The three moved to the counter and sat as the old counterman smoothed his white mustache and asked, "What'll it be, gentlemen?"<br>"Mr. Park," said the one in the middle, the one wearing sunglasses.<br>"Park's sick," said the counterman. "You wanna start with coffee?"<br>The three young men sat silently, barely wet from the pouring rain, their car probably parked within a few feet of the diner. The three men watched the old man pour them coffee. Their cups sat untouched. The old counterman put out the sugar and sugar substitutes and a small metal pitcher of milk.<br>"When will Mr. Park return?" the young man with glasses said, without a trace of accent.<br>The old counterman shrugged his thin shoulder and said, "Couldn't say. Pretty sick. Something with his stomach. Hypotonectosis, I'm talking over the place for a while, maybe a long while." The counterman heaved a heavy sigh and looked around the place. "Thought I was safely retired, but...what'll it be? Hotcakes, eggs, fruit and yogurt cup? Strawberries are fresh."<br>"Fruit and yogurt," said the young man, removing his glasses to clean the rain off with a napkin.<br>The old man looked at the flankers who shook their head without speaking. The old man shrugged and called the order back to someone in the kitchen. Then he moved from behind the counter with the coffee pot in his hand to give a refill to the burly man who grumbled something about the Cubs having no pitchers again, about someone named Dickerson giving up two runs in the eighth.<br>The old man shook his head sympathetically as he retreated behind the counter and returned the pitcher to the hot plate. He picked up the fruit cup and delivered it to the young Korean whose glasses were now cleaned to his satisfaction back on his nose.<br>"We have come to collect," said the young man, "I am sure Mr. Park informed you that we come in every other Friday to collect."<br>The old man looked puzzled. "Park got sick suddenly. Rushed to the hospital. I talked to his daughter, said I'd take over. Park's an old friend. How's the yogurt cup?"<br>"These strawberries are not fresh," said the young man. "They were frozen."<br>"I swear on my mother's life," the old man said shaking his head. "I thought we had fresh strawberries. You want me to take it back? No charge."<br>He reached for the cup. The young man grabbed his wrist and held it tightly. One of the other two men looked at the man reading his newspaper. The burly man didn't seem to be paying any attention.<br>"We collect one hundred dollars every two weeks," the man in the glasses said softly, "Today is collection day."<br>"Collect?" said the counterman, trying to pull his arm away. "For what?"<br>"Protection," said the young man.<br>"From who, what?" the old man said, still trying to free his arm.<br>"From us," the young man said softly. "Park pays. We don't break his windows. We don't mess the place up. We don't mess up Park or his family. What we could do to Park, we could to you. Hypo..."<br>"...tonectosis," the old man finished.<br>"You'll wish you were in the hospital with it next to park. You understand?"<br>"This is a shakedown," the old man said, frightened but also angry. "This is blackmail."<br>"Now you understand," the young man said, letting go of the counterman's arm. "Every other week we collect one hundred dollars from every Korean business in the neighborhood."<br>"I'm not Korean," said the old man.<br>"As of right now, till Park returns, you are acting Korean," said the young man, adjusting his dark glasses as the counterman rubbed his wrist and looked at all three of the young men. The one on the right smiled slightly.<br>"Blackmail," repeated the old man.<br>"Extortion," the young man with glasses corrected.<br>"I'm not paying," said the old man, backing away from the counter.<br>The young man in the middle, the leader who had grabbed the old man's wrist, put his palms together and touched his hand to his lips as if in prayer.<br>"Then," he said, "We will begin by breaking two of your fingers and destroying the kitchen."<br>The two young men flanking the leader got up from their stools. One of them moved around the counter heading for the counterman. The other headed slowly toward the kitchen.<br>"You hear all that?" the counterman said.<br>"Clear as spring rain," answered the burly man, still looking at his newspaper.<br>"Leave now," the young man with glasses said to the burly man. The man who was heading for the kitchen paused at the customer's table and a knife suddenly appeared in the young man's hand, a long, thin-bladed knife. He pointed it at the burly man.<br>"OK," said the old counterman, wearily stepping back in front of the bespectacled Korean.<br>The young man smiled and then, to this total surprise, the old counterman reached over, grabbed the front of his jacket, and with an unexpected strength yanked the young man onto the counter, overturning the yogurt plate and one of the cups of coffee. The young Korean was appalled to finds the barrel of a pistol pressed up against the right lens of his glasses.<br>When the other two young m en moved to help their leader, the burly man lowered his newspaper, revealing a pistol in his hand. "Stop there," he said.<br>The two ignored him and took a step forward. The young man looking into the gun barrel shuddered.<br>"I said 'stop' in clear, plain, loud English," the burly man shouted, firing his weapon with the ceiling.<br>This time, the two mean stopped.<br>"You OK, Rabbi?" the burly cop said, sliding out of the booth, weapon aimed at the frozen young Koreans.<br>"Lovely, Father Murphy," said the old man, releasing the young man with the glasses but keeping the gun leveled at his head.<br>"Tape?" asked the burly cop, knocking the knife from the hand of the young man nearest him.<br>Gun still leveled, the old man reached beneath the counter and pulled out a small tape recorded. "I'll leave it running in case these gentlemen have anything more to say."<br>None of three Koreans spoke as the two policemen handcuffed them behind their backs.<br>"Let's set a record booking 'em," said the burly man. pushing the two young men toward the door. "Iris and I have an appointment with Father Parker about the wedding."<br>"You could've told me earlier," said Lieberman, removing his apron and pocketing the tape recorder.<br>"Slipped my mind," said Hanrahan.<br>"Slipped his mind." Lieberman said to the bespectacled young man as if they were friend. "You believe that?"<br>The young man said nothing as Lieberman guided him around the counter and had him join his partners at the front door. The young man was known only as Kim to his small gang and to the Korean businessmen he robbed. Kim's goals in life were to look as dry as Clint Eastwood and as cool as a young Robert Mitchum and to become very wealthy and respected. He and his gang had been at this extortion game for almost a year. They had done well. Until now. Kim was humiliated, beaten by a skinny old man.<br>"I'll get the car," Hanrahan said, putting his gun back in the holster under his jacket.<br>"I'll entertain our visitors," said Lieberman.<br>Hanrahan opened the door, looked at the downpour and turned to say, "I'll have the door open. Get 'em in fast."<br>"Like the Flash," said Lieberman, and his partner dashed out into the rain. "You know the Flash?"<br>The question was directed at the three handcuffed young men. The one nearest Lieberman was having trouble keeping his glasses on his nose with his hands cuffed behind him.<br>"The Flash was in the comics," said Lieberman with a sigh at the lack of education of the young. "When I was a kid he wore a tin helmet with wings, like Mercury. Then they stuck him in a tight red suit."<br>The Koreans seemed even more bewildered.<br>"OK now?" came a timid voice behind Lieberman.<br>"OK now," Lieberman answered.<br>From the kitchen two people emerged. Park and his wife. They were in their fifties and held back in fear, not completely sure that what they had done was the right thing.<br>"We will talk again," the young man in glasses said to the couple.<br>"That would be a bad idea," Lieberman said, moving to Kim's side. He moved close enough to whisper in the man's ear.

Hailed as the "dean of American women landscape architects", Ellen Shipman designed over 650 gardens between 1914 and 1946. Her commissions spanned the United States from the state of Washington to Ohio and Maine, and from Long Island's Gold Coast down to Louisiana. Her clients included Fords, Astors, du Ponts, and other captains of industry and patrons of the arts, yet she held an emphatically democratic view of her profession and stated: "Gardening opens a wider door than any other of the arts - all mankind can walk through, rich or poor, high or low, talented and untalented. It has no distinctions, all are welcome."<br>Judith Tankard describes Shipman's remarkable life, including her adventurous childhood at American frontier outposts, her years in the artists' colony of Cornish, New Hampshire, and her long association with architect Charles Platt. She explains how Shipman's artistic approach to the design and planting of a garden, while influenced by the British style which was fashionable at the time, was completely American in spirit and impact.<br>Shipman was an active advocate for women in the profession. She trained many successful designers in her all-woman practice, and in lectures and interviews articulated her belief that women practitioners were responsible for the gardening revival that enlivened the early twentieth century.<br>Illustrated with original photographs of Shipman's superb gardens - many by photographer Mattie Edwards Hewitt which have never been previously published - and new photographs by Carol Betsch which were specially commissioned for this volume, the book documents in fascinating detail the life and work of one of America's most important and influential garden designers.</p><p>American Horticultural Society Book Award Winner; author Judith B.

Dean and his wife, Gerda, live in southern California.The King of Creep is back, not with a novel, however, but with his first collection of short fiction. Fourteen stories, two of which are actually novel length, provide Koontz with various venues for exploring eeriness. The title piece, one of the two very long works in the collection, is the tale of a young man's hallucinations; the other long story, entitled "Chase," is a dark, almost dank psychological suspense yarn. An out-and-out monster appears in the shorter "Black Pumpkin," and "Bruno" is a combination sf and detective story. Other stories take different approaches to tingling the reader's spine, but all are successful. Koontz's legion of fans won't be let down. <i>Brad Hooper</i></p><h2>Concentric Circles of Concern: Seven Stages for Making Disciples</h2><p>In this stylish re-issue of W.

Controlling them both, Nero&#x2019;s mother, Julia Agrippina the Younger, Roman empress, great-granddaughter of the Emperor Augustus, sister of the Emperor Caligula, niece and fourth wife of Emperor Claudius.<br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>James Romm seamlessly weaves together the life and written words, the moral struggles, political intrigue, and bloody vengeance that enmeshed Seneca the Younger in the twisted imperial family and the perverse, paranoid regime of Emperor Nero, despot and madman.<br><br> Romm writes that Seneca watched over Nero as teacher, moral guide, and surrogate father, and, at seventeen, when Nero abruptly ascended to become emperor of Rome, Seneca, a man never avid for political power became, with Nero, the ruler of the Roman Empire. We see how Seneca was able to control his young student, how, under Seneca&#x2019;s influence, Nero ruled with intelligence and moderation, banned capital punishment, reduced taxes, gave slaves the right to file complaints against their owners, pardoned prisoners arrested for sedition. But with time, as Nero grew vain and disillusioned, Seneca was unable to hold sway over the emperor, and between Nero&#x2019;s mother, Agrippina&#x2014;thought to have poisoned her second husband, and her third, who was her uncle (Claudius), and rumored to have entered into an incestuous relationship with her son&#x2014;and Nero&#x2019;s father, described by Suetonius as a murderer and cheat charged with treason, adultery, and incest, how long could the young Nero have been contained?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><i>Dying Every Day</i> is a portrait of Seneca&#x2019;s moral struggle in the midst of madness and excess. In his treatises, Seneca preached a rigorous ethical creed, exalting heroes who defied danger to do what was right or embrace a noble death. As Nero&#x2019;s adviser, Seneca was presented with a more complex set of choices, as the only man capable of summoning the better aspect of Nero&#x2019;s nature, yet, remaining at Nero&#x2019;s side and colluding in the evil regime he created.<br><br> <i>Dying Every Day</i> is the first book to tell the compelling and nightmarish story of the philosopher-poet who was almost a king, tied to a tyrant&#x2014;as Seneca, the paragon of reason, watched his student spiral into madness and whose descent saw five family murders, the Fire of Rome, and a savage purge that destroyed the supreme minds of the Senate&#x2019;s golden age.</p><p>James Romm is the James H.

Nero had&nbsp;grown up, and Seneca had grown old. The princeps had found new allies,&nbsp;among them another former tutor, a Greek freedman named Anicetus&nbsp;(&#x201c;Invincible&#x201d;). Nero had elevated this man to admiral of the Misenum&nbsp;fleet, a naval force he was grooming to be his own corps d&#x2019;�lite&#x2014; the Praetorians&nbsp;being more devoted to his mother. Other freedmen, slaves, and&nbsp;foreigners had begun to rise at court, men whose complete dependence&nbsp;and subservience gratified Nero. The voices that whispered against Seneca&nbsp;and Burrus had grown in number and stridency, and Nero had shown&nbsp;more willingness to listen.<br><br>It was to Anicetus, not to Seneca or Burrus, that Nero turned as he&nbsp;approached the great crisis of his reign, in the summer of 59. By that&nbsp;time, the young man&#x2019;s love for Poppaea had brought him to a pitch of&nbsp;dire resolve. He had decided on a crime that the future will believe with&nbsp;difficulty, and ages to come, with reluctance, as the play Octavia forecast&#x2014;correctly. He had decided to kill his mother.<br><br>It was what he had wanted to do years before but was prevented by Seneca&nbsp;and Burrus. Now, abetted by Anicetus, Nero found the courage to&nbsp;act. Perhaps Poppaea goaded him on, as Tacitus claims, by insisting she&nbsp;could never be his wife as long as Agrippina lived. But Nero needed no<br> Lady Macbeth to harangue him into crime. He had already killed his&nbsp;adoptive brother on his own initiative; his mother posed a greater threat&nbsp;and caused him greater psychic torment.<br><br>Did Seneca take part in Nero&#x2019;s matricidal plan? Tacitus wondered but&nbsp;didn&#x2019;t know. Dio made Seneca chief instigator, though like much of his&nbsp;testimony on Seneca, this seems little more than slander. The question of&nbsp;collaboration is indeed hard to resolve. A princeps could not have easily&nbsp;hid such a plot from a high- ranked counselor, but perhaps Seneca no longer&nbsp;ranked very high. If Nero kept him in the dark, declining to consult&nbsp;his old ally against Agrippina, then relations between teacher and pupil&nbsp;had truly gone downhill. If Seneca was consulted, he may have seen he&nbsp;could not prevent Nero from acting but could at least help him succeed.&nbsp;Under that scenario, he may have consented to murder if it could be done&nbsp;cunningly, so as to look like an accident.<br><br>Cunning was indeed what was needed, for a daughter of Germanicus&nbsp;could not be attacked either with blades or legal writs. Poison too was&nbsp;out of the question; Agrippina, having long suspected Nero&#x2019;s intentions,&nbsp;had taken precautions, perhaps even fortifying herself with antidotes. A&nbsp;technologically savvy method was called for, and Nero was a great lover of&nbsp;technology. One day he saw in the theater, according to Dio, a collapsible&nbsp;boat that fell apart when a lever was worked, simulating a shipwreck. The&nbsp;idea took root in his obsessed mind. With a move as clean and remote as&nbsp;the proverbial push of a button, Nero could crush his mother, or drown&nbsp;her, or both, far out in the water and away from the public&#x2019;s eyes. He&nbsp;delegated the mission to Anicetus.<br><br>Constructing the trick ship in secret was no simple task. Anicetus no&nbsp;doubt recruited his best shipwrights at Misenum and also trained loyal&nbsp;sailors who would crew on the fateful voyage. Meanwhile Nero set about&nbsp;making up with his mother. The two had become estranged of late&#x2014;<br> some breakup had followed their overly intimate union&#x2014; but Nero hastened&nbsp;to repair the breach. He had to regain Agrippina&#x2019;s trust enough to&nbsp;get her on that boat.<br><br>Writing in jocular tones, admitting to having lost his temper, Nero&nbsp;cajoled his mother into joining him at Baiae, the sumptuous resort surrounded&nbsp;by lakes and a quiet bay, for the celebration of that year&#x2019;s Quinquatria,&nbsp;a rite of Minerva held at the spring equinox.<br><br>Both Nero and his mother had villas at Baiae, as did many of the&nbsp;Roman elite. The place was famous for high living, loose morals, and&nbsp;easy pleasures, a den of vice that good men should shun, in the eyes&nbsp;of Seneca&#x2014; though he did sometimes go there. In his disdain, Seneca&nbsp;painted a vivid picture: &#x201c;Why do we need to see drunken men wandering&nbsp;the beach and boaters on riotous pleasure cruises, and the lakes resounding&nbsp;with songs of musicians? . . . Do you think Cato would ever have&nbsp;lived there, to count the adulteresses as they sail past, the many kinds&nbsp;of boats painted with vivid colors, the roses bobbing everywhere on the&nbsp;lake&#x2019;s surface?&#x201d; No was of course his answer, though he perhaps made the&nbsp;high season at Baiae sound more appealing than he meant to.<br><br>Boating was the great thing at Baiae. Because most of the villas stood&nbsp;along a curving shore, or across a small bay at Puteoli, partiers could get&nbsp;from house to house by boat, putting in at small private docks. In her&nbsp;grander days, Agrippina had plied these waters in a state warship rowed&nbsp;by picked sailors. Just down the coast from her villa, an estate called&nbsp;Bauli, was the naval station at Misenum, where such ships and crews&nbsp;stood ready. Now, though, it was a different boat that arrived from Misenum&nbsp;for her use, a luxury yacht fi tted out with regal ornaments, manned&nbsp;by a special crew&#x2014; many of them Anicetus&#x2019; trained assassins.<br><br>Nero had this boat moored at a Baiae villa, where he had arranged&nbsp;a grand dinner party in Agrippina&#x2019;s honor. He presented the boat to his&nbsp;mother after dinner as a gift. It was only one of the many filial gestures&nbsp;he made that night, in an effort to overcome her distrust. Agrippina had<br> her guard up, for she had long suspected her son might seek her life. But the splendidly arrayed ship appealed to her vanity, and Nero&#x2019;s kisses, as he&nbsp;put her on board, seemed sincere.<br><br>It was a cloudless, windless night, &#x201c;with a calm that seemed sent by&nbsp;the gods to reveal the crime,&#x201d; as Tacitus says in one of his most memorable&nbsp;sentences. The ship slipped along through shallow water, on its&nbsp;coasting voyage from Baiae to Bauli. Agrippina reclined with a friend,&nbsp;Acerronia, on a special couch on the vessel&#x2019;s rear deck. The two women&nbsp;talked warmly of the evening&#x2019;s entertainment and of the fond attentions&nbsp;of Nero. Nearby stood another of Agrippina&#x2019;s entourage, her procurator&#x2014;manager of her estates&#x2014; Crepereius Gallus.<br><br>Without warning, a section of roofi ng above these three collapsed,&nbsp;slamming onto Gallus with the full force of its lead- reinforced weight.&nbsp;The man was immediately crushed to death.<br><br>Had Agrippina not been reclining on her couch, or had Acerronia not&nbsp;been sitting lower still as she bent over her friend&#x2019;s feet, both would have&nbsp;died with Gallus. But the couch saved them. Its back and arms extended&nbsp;high enough to block the force of the falling lead. The two women got<br> out from under the lethal weight and emerged into a frantic scene.<br><br>Anicetus&#x2019; agents among the crew were trying to complete their mission.&nbsp;They had expected the ship to break apart and pitch Agrippina into&nbsp;the sea, but this had failed to happen. Confused and seemingly lacking a&nbsp;backup plan, they rushed about on the boat&#x2019;s splintered deck. Some had<br> the idea of capsizing the craft by putting all their weight on one side. But&nbsp;other crewmen who were not part of the plot, perhaps surmising what&nbsp;their comrades were up to, countered them by running to the opposite&nbsp;side. Shouts echoed across the bay&#x2019;s still surface, barely heard, if at all, by&nbsp;those on shore.<br><br>As the boat gradually tipped, Agrippina and Acerronia slid into the&nbsp;water. Acerronia, perhaps failing to see the design behind the calamity,&nbsp;called out that she was Agrippina and asked for rescue. Her cries drew a&nbsp;hail of blows from oars and other naval gear, as nearby assassins saw a&nbsp;chance to finish their job. Acerronia was clubbed to death in the water,&nbsp;while Agrippina, who had kept a prudent silence, took only a hit on the shoulder. Glimpsing the lanterns of some fishing smacks nearby, she&nbsp;swam off unnoticed. Indefatigable to the last, she had escaped Nero&#x2019;s&nbsp;deathtrap.<br><br>Safely returned to Bauli, Agrippina reflected on her position. Nero&nbsp;clearly meant to kill her but had gone to extreme lengths to keep the&nbsp;crime secret. Her high stature as daughter of Germanicus, and her son&#x2019;s&nbsp;timidity, had prevented an open attack, and these might now be enough&nbsp;to save her. She sent a messenger to Nero to inform him of the night&#x2019;s&nbsp;events, pretending it had all been a freak accident. If she could feign trust&nbsp;in her son, prevent him from striking a second blow, she could somehow&nbsp;rally support and strengthen her position. Already crowds of well- wishers,&nbsp;festival- goers who had heard about the collapse of the ship, were gathered&nbsp;outside her villa. She had a fighting chance, if she could only survive this&nbsp;night.<br><br>Meanwhile at Baiae, Nero, accompanied by Anicetus, had fretted for&nbsp;hours awaiting word of the plot&#x2019;s outcome. The news that it had failed&nbsp;sent him into a tailspin. He knew that his mother would now spot his&nbsp;intentions. Wounded but not killed, Agrippina would become more dangerous<br> than ever. She might march on his villa that very night with a band&nbsp;of armed slaves, or make her way back to Rome to denounce him before&nbsp;the Senate. Nero was determined that his mother must die before the&nbsp;next day dawned, but he had no idea how to proceed. In despair, he sent&nbsp;for his two senior counselors to be roused from their chambers&#x2014; Seneca&nbsp;and Burrus.<br><br>None of Seneca&#x2019;s meditations on morality, Virtue, Reason, and the&nbsp;good life could have prepared him for this. Before him, as he entered&nbsp;Nero&#x2019;s room, stood a frightened and enraged youth of twenty- three, his&nbsp;student and prot�g� for the past ten years. For the past fi ve, he had allied&nbsp;with the princeps against his dangerous mother. Now the path he had&nbsp;first opened for Nero, by supporting his dalliance with Acte, had led to a&nbsp;botched murder and a political debacle of the first magnitude. It was too&nbsp;late for Seneca to detach himself. The path had to be followed to its end.<br><br>Every word Seneca wrote, every treatise he published, must be read&nbsp;against his presence in this room at this moment. He stood in silence for&nbsp;a long time, as though contemplating the choices before him. There were&nbsp;no good ones. When he fi nally spoke, it was to pass the buck to Burrus.&nbsp;Seneca asked whether Burrus could dispatch his Praetorians to take<br> Agrippina&#x2019;s life.<br><br>Now it was Burrus&#x2019; turn to face the awful choices that came with&nbsp;collaboration. He too declined to do what the situation, and what full&nbsp;loyalty to Nero, demanded. The Praetorians, he said, had too strong an&nbsp;allegiance to Agrippina, and to the memory of her father. He suggested&nbsp;that Anicetus and the sailors at Misenum finish what they had started.&nbsp;<br><br>Nero&#x2019;s old guard had temporized at a critical pass and thus ceded&nbsp;power to the new. Anicetus eagerly took on the task that Seneca and&nbsp;Burrus had cast off, and Nero instantly affirmed how highly he rated&nbsp;this boon. &#x201c;Only today did I get control of the empire,&#x201d; he declared,&nbsp;&#x201c;and it was a mere freedman who conferred such a great gift.&#x201d; This barb&nbsp;was aimed at Seneca who, despite having worked for a decade to firm up&nbsp;Nero&#x2019;s power, had now been found wanting. The sage&#x2019;s influence over the&nbsp;princeps, long in decline, had taken another lurch downward.<br><br>With opportune timing, the messenger sent earlier by Agrippina,&nbsp;Agerinus, now arrived with news of his mistress&#x2019;s &#x201c;accident.&#x201d; Nero was&nbsp;grateful for a pretext, however slim, to move openly against his mother.&nbsp;As Agerinus delivered his message, Nero dropped a sword by the man&#x2019;s&nbsp;feet and ordered him seized as an assassin. Then he dispatched Anicetus&nbsp;to Bauli.<br><br>It was well past midnight when Anicetus&#x2019; hit squad arrived at Agrippina&#x2019;s&nbsp;villa. In spite of the hour, the grounds and beach were thronged with&nbsp;Agrippina&#x2019;s well- wishers. Anicetus ordered them to disperse, then broke&nbsp;down the door and began removing household slaves.<br><br>Agrippina was in her bedroom with a lone servant, but even this last&nbsp;companion disappeared when armed men were heard in the house. The&nbsp;queen mother was alone when Anicetus and two other officers burst into her room. She had been hoping it was her messenger Agerinus arriving;<br> his long delay meant she was still in grave danger.<br><br>Agrippina&#x2019;s only chance was to shame her attackers out of completing&nbsp;their mission, to remind them of the glory of her line. But she was&nbsp;exhausted, shaken from the night&#x2019;s ordeal, and wounded. The best she could manage, according to Tacitus, was to protest that Anicetus must<br> have made some terrible mistake. Surely Nero would never order her&nbsp;death.<br><br>The captain accompanying Anicetus, a man named Herculeius,&nbsp;answered by hitting her on the head with a club. The other officer standing&nbsp;by, Obaritus, drew his sword. Agrippina was all out of stratagems.&nbsp;There was little left for her but to die.<br><br>Agrippina had been betrayed by those she had put in power, by Nero&nbsp;above all, but also by Burrus, Anicetus, and not least, Seneca. The sage&nbsp;she had rescued from Corsica, who owed all he had to her, had declined&nbsp;to raise his voice against her murder. Politics had first made bedfellows of&nbsp;her and Seneca&#x2014; in the literal sense, some claimed. But politics, and her&nbsp;son&#x2019;s disordered mind, had arranged things such that only one of them&nbsp;could survive.<br><br>The foremost woman of her age&#x2014; sister of one emperor, wife of a&nbsp;second, mother of a third, the last of Germanicus&#x2019; children&#x2014; was about&nbsp;to die, friendless, abandoned, alone. One last, bold gesture remained to&nbsp;her, a gesture reported by three ancient sources. The author of Octavia&nbsp;describes it best:<br><br>Dying and wretched, she makes one last request of her assassin:<br> to sink his lethal sword in her womb.<br> &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s where to bury your sword, right here&#x2014;<br> The place from which such a monster came. . . .&#x201d;<br> After those words, she lets her sad soul<br> seep out through savage wounds<br> together with a final groan.</p><h2>English Cottage Interiors (Country)</h2><p>Presents a photographic record of cottages in England which have retained their sense of age and simplicity from earlier times</p><p>Hugh Lander is a specialist writer on the history and treatment of old buildings, and is the author of several books, including Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts of House and Cottage Restoration and The House Restorer&#39;s Guide.

The authors show that by the time children are three, they've solved problems that stumped Socrates with an agility computers still can't match. <em>The Scientist in the Crib</em> explains just how, and how much, babies and young children know and learn, and how much parents naturally teach them. In fact, <em>The Scientist in the Crib</em> argues that evolution designed us to both teach and learn. Nurture is our nature, and the drive to learn is our most important instinct.</p><p>The new science of children also reveals insights about our adult capacities, helping to solve some ancient questions: How do we know there really is a world out there? How do we know that other people have minds like ours? It turns out that we find solutions to these problems when we are very small. But these astonishing capabilities don't disappear in later life, as the authors show in their engaging discussion of humans' potential for learning. In fact, they argue that even very young children -- as well as adults use some of the same methods that allow scientists to learn so much about the world.</p><p>Written by three top scientists -- themselves parents -- who conducted much of the pioneering research in this field, <em>The Scientist in the Crib</em> is vivid, lucid, and often funny. Filled with surprises at every turn, it gives us a new view of the inner life of children and the mysteries of the mind.</p></p><p>A trio of nationally respected childhood-development scientists hailing from Berkeley and the University of Washington has authored <i>The Scientist in the Crib</i> to correct a disparity: while popular books about science speak to intelligent, perceptive adults who simply want to learn, books about babies typically just give advice, heavy on the how-to and light on the why. The authors write, "It's as if the only place you could read about evolution was in dog-breeding manuals, not in Stephen Jay Gould; as if, lacking Stephen Hawking's insights, the layman's knowledge of the cosmos was reduced to 'How to find the constellations.'"<p> <i>The Scientist in the Crib</i> changes that. Standing on the relatively recent achievements of the young field of cognitive science (pointing out that not so long ago, babies were considered only slightly animate vegetables--"carrots that could cry"), the authors succinctly and articulately sum up the state of what's now known about children's minds and how they learn. Using language that's both friendly and smart (and using equally accessible metaphors, everything from <i>Scooby-Doo</i> to <i>The Third Man</i>), <i>The Scientist in the Crib</i> explores how babies recognize and understand their fellow humans, interpret sensory input, absorb language, learn and devise theories, and take part in building their own brains.</p><p> Such science makes for great reading, but will likely prove even more useful to readers with a scientist in their own crib, acting as tonic to pseudoscientific how-to baby books that recommend everything "from flash cards, to Mozart tapes, to Better Baby Institutes."

From this fertile music scene came groundbreaking groups as far-out and diverse as Can, Kraftwerk, Amon Duul, Faust, Ash Ra Tempel, Tangerine Dream and Popol Vuh to name a few. Each of these groups as well as many, many others (32 bands total) are profiled in this book along with a wealth of rare photos, cover art, posters, and other rare visual materials. You also get a very informative overall history of krautrock, an outline of the various labels and producers associated with the movement, and essays and testimonials from Gavin Russom (DFA/Black Meteoric Star), Michel Faber, Erik Davis, David Stubbs, and more. 192 pages, softcover. RECOMMENDED.</p><p>The late 1960s in West Germany was a period of profound breakthroughs, upheavals and reversals. Communes were spreading, protests organized throughout the entire country, the desire to begin everything anew permeating the young. Out of this climate, a music scene exploded that would forever change the face of western rock; at times anarchic, at others mystical, magical, or utopian, it pushed rock beyond any known limits.<br>Never a genre or a movement per se, Krautrock encompassed a very wild and diverse range of sounds, attitudes, and past musics, from free jazz to Karlheinz Stockhausen, from dada to Fluxus, from German Romanticism to the Mothers of Invention. The musicians operated outside any known categories, breaking new ground and turning their backs to both their country&#x2019;s past and the conventions of Anglo-American rock. Their vision fired the imaginations of<br>generations of musicians after them: Cabaret Voltaire, Brian Eno, Nurse with Wound, PiL, DAF, Einsturzende Neubauten, to only name a few, have all acknowledged their debt to Krautrock&#x2019;s uncompromising ethics and innovative sounds.<br>From the relentless drum beating of Amon Duul, to the eastern-tinged mysticism of Popol Vuh and the sonic assaults of Conrad Schnitzler, <i>Krautrock: Cosmic Rock and Its Legacy</i> traces the history of this phenomenon. Illustrated with concert photos, posters, record cover art and other rare visual material, including essays by Michel Faber, Erik Davis, David Stubbs, and testimonials from Gavin Russom (Delia and Gavin/ Black Meteoric Star), Plastic Crimewave, Stephen Thrower (Coil/Cyclobe), and Ann Shenton (Add N to (X)) this is an essential compendium to a music whose spirit and ideas still vibrate through contemporary culture today.<br>Erik Davis is a contributing writer for <i>Arthur Magazine</i> and the author of <i>The Visionary State</i>.<br>David Stubbs is a contributing writer for both the <i>NME</i> and <i>The Wire</i>.<br>Ken Hollings is a writer for <i>The Wire</i>, <i>Frieze</i> and <i>Sight &amp; Sound</i> and the author of <i>Destroy All Monsters</i>.<br>David Keenan is also a writer for <i>The Wire</i> and is the author of <i>England&#x2019;s Hidden Reverse</i>, a biography of the bands Coil, Current 93 and Nurse With Wound.<br>Michel Faber is the author of <i>Under The Skin</i> and <i>The Fire Gospel</i>.<br></p><h2>Tozer Speaks: Two-Volume Set: 128 Compelling &amp; Authoritative Teachings of A.W.

The wooden painted doll appeared in Russia in 1890&#39;s, the period which saw burgeoning economic and cultural development.

Through a dizzingly constructed labyrinth of secrets, the magic of books, passion, and friendship blend into a masterful story. </p> <strong>Carlos Ruiz Zaf�n on <i>The Angel's Game</i></strong><br><br> Years ago, when I began working on my fifth novel, <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i>, I started toying around with the idea of creating a fictional universe that would be articulated through four interconnected stories in which we would meet some of the same characters at different times in their lives, and see them from different perspectives where many plots and subplots would tie around in knots for the reader to untie. It sounds somewhat pretentious, but my idea was to add a twist to the story and provide the reader with what I hoped would be a stimulating and playful reading experience. Since these books were, in part, about the world of literature, books, reading and language, I thought it would be interesting to use the different novels to explore those themes through different angles and to add new layers to the meaning of the stories. <br> <p>At first I thought this could be done in one book, but soon I realized it would make <i>Shadow of the Wind</i> a monster novel, and in many ways, destroy the structure I was trying to design for it. I realized I would have to write four different novels. They would be stand-alone stories that could be read in any order. I saw them as a Chinese box of stories with four doors of entry, a labyrinth of fictions that could be explored in many directions, entirely or in parts, and that could provide the reader with an additional layer of enjoyment and play. These novels would have a central axis, the idea of the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, set against the backdrop of a highly stylized, gothic and mysterious Barcelona. Since each novel was going to be complex and difficult to write, I decided to take one at a time and see how the experiment evolved on its own in an organic way.</p> <p>It all sounds very complicated, but it is not. At the end of the day, these are just stories that share a universe, a tone and some central themes and characters. You don&#x2019;t need to care or know about any of this stuff to enjoy them. One of the fun things about this process was it allowed me to give each book a different personality. Thus, if <i>Shadow of the Wind</i> is the nice, good girl in the family, <i>The Angel&#x2019;s Game</i> would be the wicked gothic stepsister. Some readers often ask me if <i>The Angel&#x2019;s Game</i> is a prequel or a sequel. The answer is: none of these things, and all of the above. Essentially <i>The Angel&#x2019;s Game</i> is a new book, a stand-alone story that you can fully enjoy and understand on its own. But if you have already read <i>The Shadow of the Wind</i>, or you decide to read it afterwards, you&#x2019;ll find new meanings and connections that I hope will enhance your experience with these characters and their adventures. </p> <i>The Angel&#x2019;s Game</i> has many games inside, one of them with the reader. It is a book designed to make you step into the storytelling process and become a part of it. In other words, the wicked, gothic chick wants your blood. Beware. Maybe, without realizing, I ended up writing a monster book after all... Don&#x2019;t say I didn&#x2019;t warn you, courageous reader. I&#x2019;ll see you on the other side. <i>--Carlos Ruiz Zaf�n</i><p></p> <p>(Photo � Isolde Ohlbaum) </p>Carlos Ruiz Zaf�n is the author of <b>The Shadow of the Wind</b> and other novels.

A two-time recipient of the Golden Leaf Award, she has been a RITA Award finalist and has garnered several awards from Romantic Times magazine.Howell continues the Murray saga (Highland Destiny, etc.) with a 15th-century tale of conspiracy and treason. Ilsabeth Murray Armstrong overhears her fianc� plotting to betray her. When the king's agent is murdered and the Armstrongs blamed, Ilsabeth flees to Simon Innes, a reputable investigator and close family friend. The king wants Simon to find the Armstrongs. The Murrays want him to identify the real murderer. Ilsabeth just wants him to unravel the tangled plots and prove her innocence--and to love her, of course, since she fell in love with him almost on sight. Simon distrusts all women, especially pretty ones, but with two winsome orphans, a crotchety butler, a bossy housekeeper, and a meddling Murray cousin all lending a hand, Simon doesn't have the chance to guard his heart.

Explorer Guiseppe Giaweeni leaves Italy to look for China with the King and Queen's blessing?"And don't be a stranger" ringing in his ears. Instead of China, he discovers Miami and a lost tribe of Giants called the Mishbookers who reside there. After some horse trading and fast talking, Giaweeni convinces Joe to return to Europe with him. Joe is billed as the Eighth Wonder of the World and, after much anticipation, performs before a packed theater. Unfortunately, the people in the audience misinterpret Joe's dance and, thinking he's gone berserk, flee for their lives. Giaweeni returns the giant to his family and heads out to discover new lands. And the Mishbookers, well, they moved to Long Island, "But this is not a proven fact." The Yiddish phrases, sprinkled throughout the narrative, provide much of the story's amusement. Sendak's watercolors overflow the pages, with larger-than-life characters and activities. Visual puns, such as a boot stepping on a china plate, add to the book's broad humor. The text's comic patter partnered with the slapstick illustrations are reminiscent of a vaudeville act?there's a lot of adult humor here, and quite a bit that kids will find downright silly.?Karen K. Radtke, Milwaukee Public Library<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Following his profoundly political We Are All in the Dumps with Jack and Guy, Sendak applies his prodigious talents to this self-indulgent tale by Yorinks (Hey, Al), Sendak's partner in The Night Kitchen, a foundation for children's theater. An ungainly combination of Gulliver's Travels, the Christopher Columbus story and satire about Jewish retirees in Miami Beach, the narrative sends one Giuseppe Giaweeni from 15th- or 16th-century Italy across the sea in search of China; he lands in Miami. "My-mom-mee?" reads a voice bubble over one crewman's head. "Me-hoo-mee?" asks the dog, "May-hem-mee?" questions another traveler, and, in one of many bits of shtick, Giaweeni himself says, "So I swerved a little." There they find "a lost tribe of dancing giants" known as the Mishbookers (how many readers will know that this name is related to the Yiddish word for "family"?). Giaweeni brings one Joe Mishbooker back to Europe to perform onstage ("Where's the bathroom?" asks the giant, squeezed into a palazzo, his head scraping the ceiling). But the audience flees the theater on Joe's opening night-are Yorinks and Sendak mocking the puniness of readers who fail to appreciate artists of great stature? Unfortunately, their collaboration is likely to merit much the same reception as Giaweeni and Joe's. Not even Sendak's superbly colored and operatically conceived illustrations can turn this in-joke into a story for public consumption.

Where did you leave car?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;A little way up the street.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What make?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the old white Merc by the lamppost.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Locking is remote, right?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny dipped his hand in his pocket, opened his palm and showed the key fob with its push button controls.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Very good,&#x201d; Mr. Singh said. &#x201c;We can test. Go to car and let yourself in. Step out, lock up and walk back here. I am waiting on street with gizmo.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny was alert for trickery. He wasn&#x2019;t parting with sixty-odd pounds for a useless lump of plastic and metal. But if it really did work, he could be quids in. Thousands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gizmo, as Mr. Singh called it, looked pretty basic in construction, a pocket-sized black box with two retractable antennas fitted to one end.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No money had changed hands yet, so the guy had nothing to gain by doing a runner. Danny stepped out of the little coffee shop and did exactly as suggested. Walked to<br>the Mercedes, unlocked, got in, closed the door, opened it again, stepped out, locked, using the smart key, and walked back to where Mr. Singh was standing outside the shop with the gizmo in his hands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You locked it, right?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sure did,&#x201d; Danny said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Where is key?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Back in my pocket.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Excellent. Leave it there. Now go to car and try door.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny had walked only a few steps when he saw that the lock pins were showing. Just as promised, the car was unlocked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was impressed. To be certain, he opened the door he&#x2019;d apparently locked a moment ago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Good job, eh?&#x201d; Mr. Singh said when Danny went back to him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Nice one. Who makes these things?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Made in China.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t you know it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Simple to operate. You want to buy?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How does it work?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Okay. You know how key fob works?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Using a radio signal.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Right. Sending signal from fob to car. Programmed to connect with your car and no other. But this gizmo is signal jammer. Breaks frequency. You think you lock up, but I zap you with this.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let me see.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny held the thing and turned it over. &#x201c;All I have to do is press this?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Correct. All about timing. You are catching exact moment when driver is pointing fob at car.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Hang on. There&#x2019;s always a sound when the locks engage. And the lights flick on and off. If that doesn&#x2019;t happen, the driver will notice.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did you notice?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny hesitated. &#x201c;There was traffic noise and I was thinking of other things.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So?&#x201d; Mr. Singh flashed his teeth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;In a quiet place the driver would notice.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t use in quiet place. Street is better, street with much traffic.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny turned the jammer over and looked at the other side, speculating. &#x201c;How much are you asking?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Seventy, battery included.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He made a sound as if he&#x2019;d been burnt. &#x201c;Seventy is more than I thought.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Fully effective up to fifty metres.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny handed it back. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose it works with the latest models.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Now I am being honest. Very new cars, possibly no. Manufacturers getting wise. Any car up to last year is good. That gives plenty choice. To you, special offer, not to be repeated. Sixty-five.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny took a wad from his back pocket, peeled off three twenties and held them out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Singh sighed, took the money and handed over the jammer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Before you go,&#x201d; Danny said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something else. This gets me into the car, but it doesn&#x2019;t let me drive it away. I was told you have another little beauty for that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Singh&#x2019;s eyes lit up again. &#x201c;Programmer. Which make? BMW, Mercedes, Audi?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I need a different one for each make, do I? How much will it cost me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Two hundred. Maybe two fifty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danny whistled. This was getting to be a larger investment than he planned, but he thought about the top-class cars he could steal. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s say the Bimmer.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;BMW three or five series I can do for two hundred.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is it difficult to operate?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Dead easy. All cars now have diagnostic connector port. You plug in and programmer reads key code.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Then what?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Code is transferred from car&#x2019;s computer to microchip in new key. You get five blank keys gratis as well.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So I can drive off using the new key? Have you tried this yourself?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No, no, no, I am supplier only. Supplying is lawful. Driving off with some person&#x2019;s car is not.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But you can show me how the thing works?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You come back with two hundred cash this time tomorrow and for you as special customer I am supplying and demonstrating BMW three series programmer.&#x201d;<br>Next afternoon special customer Danny drove away from Brighton with the programmer and the pride of a man at the cutting edge of the electronic revolution. In his youth he&#x2019;d used a wire coat hanger to get into cars. He&#x2019;d graduated to a slim Jim strip and then a whole collection of lock-picking tools. But the days of hotwiring the ignition were long gone. In recent years anti-theft technology had become so sophisticated that he&#x2019;d been reduced to touring car parks looking for vehicles left unlocked by their stupid owners. For a man once known as Driveaway Danny it had become humiliating. The Mercedes he was driving was twelve years old. He&#x2019;d liberated it in July from some idiot in Bognor who&#x2019;d left it on his driveway with the key in the ignition.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything was about to change.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He would shortly be driving a BMW 3 series.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t easy to nail one. For more than a week he patrolled the streets of the south coast town of Littlehampton (which isn&#x2019;t known for executive cars) with his two gizmos in a Tesco carrier bag. The new technology called for a whole new mindset. He wasn&#x2019;t on the lookout for a parked car, but one that happened to drive up while he was watching. He&#x2019;d need to make a snap decision when the chance came. <i>If</i> the chance came.<br><br>Late Sunday evening it did. After a day of no success he was consoling himself with a real ale at his local, the Steam Packet, near the red footbridge over the River Arun. He lived in a one-bedroom flat a few hundred yards away and liked to wind down here at the end of a long day. The pub was said to have existed since 1840, trading under a different name, because the cross-channel ferry that departed from there hadn&#x2019;t come into service until 1863. <i>Welcome Aboard the Steam Packet,</i> announced the large wooden board attached to the front with a profile of a paddle steamer&#x2014;and in case the maritime message was overlooked, the north side of the pub had a ship&#x2019;s figurehead of a topless blonde (in the best possible taste, with strategically dangling curls) projecting from the wall. With a little imagination when seated in the terrace at the back overlooking River Road and the Arun you could believe yourself afloat. This was a favourite spot of Danny&#x2019;s, nicely placed for seeing spectacular sunsets or watching small boats chugging back from sea trips. But at this moment, alone in the half-light at one of the benches around 9:30 on a September evening, his thoughts were not about sea trips or sunsets. He&#x2019;d just decided he&#x2019;d wasted his money on Mr. Singh&#x2019;s gizmos. How ironic then that this was the moment when a silver BMW drove up and came to a halt in the parking space across the street.</p><h2>Toyota Prius, &#39;01-&#39;08 (Hayne&#39;s Automotive Repair Manual)</h2><p>Haynes offers the best coverage for cars, trucks, vans, SUVs and motorcycles on the market today.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. <i>World War Z</i> is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.<br><br>Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War. <br><br>Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, &#x201c;By excluding the human factor, aren&#x2019;t we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn&#x2019;t the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as &#x2018;the living dead&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br><br>Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.<br>Eyewitness reports from the first truly global war<br><br>&#x201c;I found &#x2018;Patient Zero&#x2019; behind the locked door of an abandoned apartment across town. . . .

Now, there are barely fifty thousand. Reconstruction funds have been slow to arrive in this part of the country, the government choosing to concentrate on the more densely populated coast. There is no central power grid, no running water besides the Yangtze River. But the streets are clear of rubble and the local "security council" has prevented any postwar outbreaks. The chairman of that council is Kwang Jingshu, a medical doctor who, despite his advanced age and wartime injuries, still manages to make house calls to all his patients.]<br><br> The first outbreak I saw was in a remote village that officially had no name. The residents called it "New Dachang," but this was more out of nostalgia than anything else. Their former home, "Old Dachang," had stood since the period of the Three Kingdoms, with farms and houses and even trees said to be centuries old. When the Three Gorges Dam was completed, and reservoir waters began to rise, much of Dachang had been disassembled, brick by brick, then rebuilt on higher ground. This New Dachang, however, was not a town anymore, but a "national historic museum." It must have been a heartbreaking irony for those poor peasants, to see their town saved but then only being able to visit it as a tourist. Maybe that is why some of them chose to name their newly constructed hamlet "New Dachang" to preserve some connection to their heritage, even if it was only in name. I personally didn't know that this other New Dachang existed, so you can imagine how confused I was when the call came in.<br><br> The hospital was quiet; it had been a slow night, even for the increasing number of drunk-driving accidents. Motorcycles were becoming very popular. We used to say that your Harley-Davidsons killed more young Chinese than all the GIs in the Korean War. That's why I was so grateful for a quiet shift. I was tired, my back and feet ached. I was on my way out to smoke a cigarette and watch the dawn when I heard my name being paged. The receptionist that night was new and couldn't quite understand the dialect. There had been an accident, or an illness. It was an emergency, that part was obvious, and could we please send help at once.<br><br> What could I say? The younger doctors, the kids who think medicine is just a way to pad their bank accounts, they certainly weren't going to go help some "nongmin" just for the sake of helping. I guess I'm still an old revolutionary at heart. "Our duty is to hold ourselves responsible to the people." Those words still mean something to me . . . and I tried to remember that as my Deer bounced and banged over dirt roads the government had promised but never quite gotten around to paving.<br><br> I had a devil of a time finding the place. Officially, it didn't exist and therefore wasn't on any map. I became lost several times and had to ask directions from locals who kept thinking I meant the museum town. I was in an impatient mood by the time I reached the small collection of hilltop homes. I remember thinking, This had better be damned serious. Once I saw their faces, I regretted my wish.<br><br> There were seven of them, all on cots, all barely conscious. The villagers had moved them into their new communal meeting hall. The walls and floor were bare cement. The air was cold and damp. Of course they're sick, I thought. I asked the villagers who had been taking care of these people. They said no one, it wasn't "safe." I noticed that the door had been locked from the outside. The villagers were clearly terrified. They cringed and whispered; some kept their distance and prayed. Their behavior made me angry, not at them, you understand, not as individuals, but what they represented about our country. After centuries of foreign oppression, exploitation, and humiliation, we were finally reclaiming our rightful place as humanity's middle kingdom. We were the world's richest and most dynamic superpower, masters of everything from outer space to cyber space. It was the dawn of what the world was finally acknowledging as "The Chinese Century" and yet so many of us still lived like these ignorant peasants, as stagnant and superstitious as the earliest Yangshao savages.<br><br> I was still lost in my grand, cultural criticism when I knelt to examine the first patient. She was running a high fever, forty degrees centigrade, and she was shivering violently. Barely coherent, she whimpered slightly when I tried to move her limbs. There was a wound in her right forearm, a bite mark. As I examined it more closely, I realized that it wasn't from an animal. The bite radius and teeth marks had to have come from a small, or possibly young, human being. Although I hypothesized this to be the source of the infection, the actual injury was surprisingly clean. I asked the villagers, again, who had been taking care of these people. Again, they told me no one. I knew this could not be true. The human mouth is packed with bacteria, even more so than the most unhygienic dog. If no one had cleaned this woman's wound, why wasn't it throbbing with infection?<br><br> I examined the six other patients. All showed similar symptoms, all had similar wounds on various parts of their bodies. I asked one man, the most lucid of the group, who or what had inflicted these injuries. He told me it had happened when they had tried to subdue "him."<br><br> "Who?" I asked.<br><br> I found "Patient Zero" behind the locked door of an abandoned house across town. He was twelve years old. His wrists and feet were bound with plastic packing twine. Although he'd rubbed off the skin around his bonds, there was no blood. There was also no blood on his other wounds, not on the gouges on his legs or arms, or from the large dry gap where his right big toe had been. He was writhing like an animal; a gag muffled his growls.<br><br> At first the villagers tried to hold me back. They warned me not to touch him, that he was "cursed." I shrugged them off and reached for my mask and gloves. The boy's skin was as cold and gray as the cement on which he lay. I could find neither his heartbeat nor his pulse. His eyes were wild, wide and sunken back in their sockets. They remained locked on me like a predatory beast. Throughout the examination he was inexplicably hostile, reaching for me with his bound hands and snapping at me through his gag.<br><br> His movements were so violent I had to call for two of the largest villagers to help me hold him down. Initially they wouldn't budge, cowering in the doorway like baby rabbits. I explained that there was no risk of infection if they used gloves and masks. When they shook their heads, I made it an order, even though I had no lawful authority to do so.<br><br> That was all it took. The two oxen knelt beside me. One held the boy's feet while the other grasped his hands. I tried to take a blood sample and instead extracted only brown, viscous matter. As I was withdrawing the needle, the boy began another bout of violent struggling.<br><br> One of my "orderlies," the one responsible for his arms, gave up trying to hold them and thought it might safer if he just braced them against the floor with his knees. But the boy jerked again and I heard his left arm snap. Jagged ends of both radius and ulna bones stabbed through his gray flesh. Although the boy didn't cry out, didn't even seem to notice, it was enough for both assistants to leap back and run from the room.<br><br> I instinctively retreated several paces myself. I am embarrassed to admit this; I have been a doctor for most of my adult life. I was trained and . . . you could even say "raised" by the People's Liberation Army. I've treated more than my share of combat injuries, faced my own death on more than one occasion, and now I was scared, truly scared, of this frail child.<br><br> The boy began to twist in my direction, his arm ripped completely free. Flesh and muscle tore from one another until there was nothing except the stump. His now free right arm, still tied to the severed left hand, dragged his body across the floor.<br><br> I hurried outside, locking the door behind me. I tried to compose myself, control my fear and shame. My voice still cracked as I asked the villagers how the boy had been infected. No one answered. I began to hear banging on the door, the boy's fist pounding weakly against the thin wood. It was all I could do not to jump at the sound. I prayed they would not notice the color draining from my face. I shouted, as much from fear as frustration, that I had to know what happened to this child.<br><br> A young woman came forward, maybe his mother. You could tell that she had been crying for days; her eyes were dry and deeply red. She admitted that it had happened when the boy and his father were "moon fishing," a term that describes diving for treasure among the sunken ruins of the Three Gorges Reservoir. With more than eleven hundred abandoned villages, towns, and even cities, there was always the hope of recovering something valuable. It was a very common practice in those days, and also very illegal. She explained that they weren't looting, that it was their own village, Old Dachang, and they were just trying to recover some heirlooms from the remaining houses that hadn't been moved. She repeated the point, and I had to interrupt her with promises not to inform the police. She finally explained that the boy came up crying with a bite mark on his foot. He didn't know what had happened, the water had been too dark and muddy. His father was never seen again.<br><br> I reached for my cell phone...</p><h2>Encyclopaedia of Medical Astrology</h2><p>Of this book, the author writes, "In my years of practice as a physician, I have, by the use of Astrology, been able to very quickly locate the seat of the disease, the cause of the trouble, the time when the patient began to feel uncomfortable, as based on the birth data of the patient, and this without even touching or examining the patient, and my intense desire to get this knowledge and wisdom before students and Healers in a classified form, is the reason for this Encyclopaedia.... When once you have discovered the cause of the disease, and understand its philosophy and the relation of the patient to the great Scheme of Nature, the matter of treatment I leave to you, and according to the System and Methods you may be using."

In 1918 he set about to compile the medical references in his many astrology books. As he himself wrote, it became a momentous task, eventually comprising two large ledgers. These were then arranged, classified, disentangled and wrote into readable form. Only at that point did he consider making a proper book of it, and set about retyping and rearranging yet again.

Peter Hosking's performance is true to Winton's unsentimental exploration into humankind's ability to love and survive amid adversity. Hosking handles the mundane and the mystical with equal assurance. His characterizations, including an aboriginal ghost and a talking pig, are earthy, real, and frequently hilarious. Hosking makes the most of Winton's honesty, wit, and original imagery. S.J.H.

But now he was looking forward to a last weekend in the capital before heading home. But Sunda was newly independent, and not entirely stable. An opposition faction with fundamentalist Islamic leanings was set on overthrowing the provisional government. And instead of enjoying a sybaritic weekend with the Eurasian beauty Rosalie, Fraser finds himself trapped with her by a fanatical group who&#x2019;ve taken over the country&#x2019;s radio station and made their headquarters in his friend Jebb&#x2019;s apartment.

Today, her growing reputation as a composer of religious music has overshadowed the astonishing variety of her accomplishments and her part in the scientific, cultural, and theological revolution of the pre-Renaissance, from religion and mysticism to medicine and sex. <b>Scivias</b>, her book of apocalyptic visions, with its extraordinary and compelling illustrations, would alone have been enough to endure her lasting fame.<br><br>The story of Hildegard's life, from her entry into a monastery at Disibodenberg on the Rhine as a child, through the exploration of her pent-up genius in middle years, to her eventual admission to the German canon of saints, is here told against a rich background of the years of the Crusades, the flowering of monasticism, papal schism and heresy. The forceful character that emerges challenges any image of demurely subjugated womanhood associated with the period. Hildegard's story is as fascinating as that of any figure in the Middle Ages, and she and her musical legacy continue to be the subject of debate a thousand years later.</p><p>Among Catholic saints, the 12th-century German abbess Hildegard of Bingen perhaps best fits the description of wild womanhood offered by Cole Porter's "The Lady Is a Tramp." That is, Hildegard did it all, she did it her way, and everyone who hears about her is amazed. Such is a fair summary of the evidence offered in <i>Hildegard of Bingen</i>, a biography by Fiona Maddocks (the chief music critic for London's <i>The Observer</i>). Hildegard is today best known for her haunting musical compositions. She was also, in Maddocks's description, "a polymath: a visionary, a theologian, a preacher; an early scientist and physician; a prodigious letter writer who numbered emperors and popes among her correspondents ... Her boldness, courage, and tenacity made her at once enthralling and haughty, intrepid, and irksome." This is a straightforward, chronologically organized biography, beginning with Hildegard's girlhood (she entered a male monastery when she was 8 years old) and ending with the story of her canonization and a contemporary account of the procession that occurs annually on her feast day in Eibingen, the site of the second convent she founded. Throughout, Maddocks reminds readers of the rich historical background of Hildegard's life (the Crusades, the rise of monasticism, the beginnings of the Renaissance), offering not only an account of one extraordinary woman but of an era whose influence on our own is still being felt. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>&#x201c;Maddocks adeptly shows why Hildegard continues to fascinate seekers.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>The Fine Print: How Big Companies Use &#34;Plain English&#34; to Rob You Blind</h2><p>&#x201c;No other modern country gives corporations the unfettered power found in America to gouge cus�tomers, shortchange workers, and erect barriers to fair play.

In <i>The River War,</i> Winston Churchill recounts a critical but often overlooked episode from the days when the British Empire was at the height of its power: the operations directed by Lord Kitchener of Khartoum on the Upper Nile from 1896 to 1899, which led to England's reconquest of the Egyptian Sudan.<br>After the 1881 rebellion of the Mahdi had plunged the Sudan into chaos, British attempts to withdraw from the region climaxed in General Gordon's ill-fated attempt to rescue officials, soldiers, and Egyptian subjects from Khartoum. A decade later, the British government began its efforts in the pacification and restoration of the Sudan--a mission that succeeded within two years, at the final battle of Omdurman.<br>Churchill was present at this decisive battle, and he wrote this book while he was still a young cavalry officer. In addition to the future statesman's views of the conflicts and the politics behind them, it shows how the River War altered the fates of England, Egypt, and the Arabian people of northeast Africa.

At once I say I am feeling unwell, and send all my women away. We are alone in my privy chamber and I let him take a stool and sit opposite me, almost as an equal.<br>&#x2018;The Queen Elizabeth summoned me to sanctuary last night and she was distraught,&#x2019; he says quietly.<br>&#x2018;She was?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;She had been told that the princes were dead, and she was begging me to tell her that it was not the case.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;What did you say?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I didn&#x2019;t know what you would have me say. So I told her what everyone in the City is saying: that they are dead. That Richard had them killed either on the day of his coronation, or as he left London.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;And she?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;She was deeply shocked; she could not believe it. But, Lady Margaret, she said a terrible thing . . .&#x2019; He breaks off, as if he dare not name it.<br>&#x2018;Go on,&#x2019; I say but I can feel a cold shiver of dread creeping up my spine. I fear I have been betrayed. I fear that this has gone wrong.<br>&#x2018;She cried out at first and then she said: &#x201c;At least Richard is safe&#x201d;.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;She meant Prince Richard? The younger boy?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;The one they took into the Tower to keep his brother company.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I know that! But what did she mean?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s what I asked her. I asked her at once what she meant and she smiled at me in the most frightening way and said: &#x201c;Doctor, if you had only two precious, rare jewels and you feared thieves, would you put your two treasures in the same box?&#x201d;&#x2019;<br>He nods at my aghast expression.<br>&#x2018;What does she mean?&#x2019; I repeat.<br>&#x2018;She wouldn&#x2019;t say more. I asked her if Prince Richard was not in the Tower when the two boys were killed? She just said that I was to ask you to put your own guards into the Tower to keep her son safe. She would say nothing more. She sent me away.&#x2019;<br>I rise from my stool. This damned woman, this witch, has been in my light ever since I was a girl, and now, at this very moment when I am using her, using her own adoring family and loyal supporters to wrench the throne from her, to destroy her sons, she may yet win, she may have done something that will spoil everything for me. How does she always do it? How is it that when she is brought so low that I can even bring myself to pray for her, she manages to turn her fortunes around? It must be witchcraft; it can only be witchcraft. Her happiness and her success have haunted my life. I know her to be in league with the devil, for sure. I wish he would take her to hell.<br>&#x2018;You will have to go back to her,&#x2019; I say, turning to him.<br>He almost looks as if he would refuse.<br>&#x2018;What?&#x2019; I snap.<br>&#x2018;Lady Margaret, I swear, I dread going to her. She is like a witch imprisoned in the cleft of a pine tree, she is like an entrapped spirit, she is like a water goddess on a frozen lake, waiting for spring. She lives in the gloom of sanctuary with the river flowing all the time beside their rooms and she listens to the babble as a counsellor. She knows things that she cannot know by earthly means. She fills me with terror. And her daughter is as bad.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You will have to summon your courage,&#x2019; I say briskly. &#x2018;Be brave, you are doing God&#x2019;s work. You have to go back to her and tell her to be of stout heart. Tell her that I am certain that the princes are alive. Remind her that when we attacked the Tower we heard the guards taking them back from the door. They were alive then, why would Richard kill them now? Richard has taken the throne without killing them, why would he put them to death now? Richard is a man who does his own work and he is hundreds of miles away from them now. Tell her I will double my people in the Tower and that I swear to her, on my honour, that I will protect them. Remind her that the uprising will start next month. As soon as we defeat Richard the king, we will set the boys free. Then, when she is reassured, when she is in her first moment of relief, when you see the colour come to her face and you have convinced her &#x2013; in that moment quickly ask her if she has her son Prince Richard in safety already? If she has him hidden away somewhere?&#x2019;<br>He nods, but he is pale with fear. &#x2018;And are they safe?&#x2019; he asks. &#x2018;Can I truly assure her that those poor boys are safe and we will rescue them? That the rumours, even in your own household, are false? Do you know if they are they alive or dead, Lady Margaret? Can I tell their mother that they are alive and speak the truth?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;They are in the hands of God,&#x2019; I reply steadily. &#x2018;As are we all. My son too. These are dangerous times, and the princes are in the hands of God.&#x2019;<br><br>That night we hear news of the first uprising. It is mistimed, it comes too early. The men of Kent are marching on London, calling on the Duke of Buckingham to take the throne. The county of Sussex gets up in arms, believing they cannot delay a moment longer, and the men of Hampshire beside them rise up too, as a fire will leap from one dry woodland to another. Richard&#x2019;s most loyal commander, Thomas Howard, the brand new Duke of Norfolk, marches down the west road from London, and occupies Guildford, fighting skirmishes to the west and to the east, but holding the rebels down in their own counties, and sending a desperate warning to the king: the counties of the south are up in the name of the former Queen and her imprisoned sons, the princes.<br>Richard, the battle-hardened leader of York, marches south at the fast speed of a York army, makes his centre of command at Lincoln, and raises troops in every county, especially from those who greeted his progress with such joy. He hears of the betrayal of the Duke of Buckingham when men come from Wales to tell him that the duke is already on the march, going north through the Welsh marches, recruiting men and clearly planning to cross at Gloucester, or perhaps Tewkesbury, to come into the heart of England with his own men and his Welsh recruits. His beloved friend, Henry Stafford, is marching out under his standard, as proudly and as bravely as once he did for Richard; only now he is marching against him.<br>Richard goes white with rage and he grips his right arm, his sword arm, above the elbow, as if he were shaking with rage, as if to hold it steady. &#x2018;A man with the best cause to be true,&#x2019; he exclaims. &#x2018;The most untrue creature living. A man who had everything he asked for. Never was a false traitor better treated; a traitor, a traitor.&#x2019;<br>At once he sends out commissions of array to every county in England demanding their loyalty, demanding their arms and their men. This is the first and greatest crisis of his new reign. He summons them to support a York king, he demands the loyalty that they gave to his brother, which they have all promised to him. He warns those who cheered when he took the crown less than sixteen weeks ago that they must now stand by that decision, or England will fall to an unholy alliance of the false Duke of Buckingham, the witch queen, and the Tudor pretender.<br>It is pouring with rain, and there is a strong wind blowing hard from the north. It is unnatural weather, witch&#x2019;s weather. My son must set sail now, if he is to arrive while the queen&#x2019;s supporters are up, and while Buckingham is marching. But if it is so foul here, in the south of England, then I fear the weather in Brittany. He must come at exactly the right moment to catch the weary victor of the first battle and make them turn and fight again, while they are sick of fighting. But &#x2013; I stand at my window and watch the rain pouring down, and the wind lashing the trees in our garden &#x2013; I know he cannot set sail in this weather, the wind is howling towards the south, I cannot believe he will even be able to get out of port.<br><br>The next day the rains are worse and the river is starting to rise. It is over our landing steps at the foot of the garden and the boatmen drag the Stanley barge up the garden to the very orchard, out of the swirling flood, fearing that it will be torn from its moorings by the current. I can&#x2019;t believe that Henry can set sail in this, and even if he were to get out of harbour, I can&#x2019;t believe that he could safely get across the English seas to the south coast. <br>My web of informers, spies and plotters are stunned by the ferocity of the rain, which is like a weapon against us. The roads into London are all but impassable; no-one can get a message through. A horse and rider cannot get from London to Guildford, and as the river rises higher, there is news of flooding and drowning upstream and down. The tides are unnaturally high and every day and night the floods from the river pour down to the inrushing tide and there is a boiling surge of water which wipes out riverside houses, quays, piers and docks. Nobody can remember weather like this, a rain storm which lasts for days, and the rivers are bursting their banks all around England.<br>I have no-one to talk to but my God, and I cannot always hear His voice, as if the rain is blotting out His very face, and the wind blowing away His words. This is how I know for sure that it is a witch&#x2019;s wind. I spend my day at the window overlooking the garden, watching the river boil over the garden wall and come up through the orchard, lap by lap, till the trees themselves seem to be stretching up to the heavy clouds for help. Whenever one of my ladies comes to my side, or Dr Lewis comes to my door, or any of the plotters in London ask for admittance, they all want to know what is happening: as if I know any more than them, when all I can hear is rain, as if I can foretell the future in the galeripped sky. But I know nothing, anything could be happening out there; a waterlogged massacre could be taking place even half a mile away, and none of us would know. We would hear no voices over the sound of the storm, no lights would show through the rain.<br>I spend my nights in my chapel, praying for the safety of my son and the success of our venture, and hearing no answer from God but only the steady hammer of the torrent on the roof and the whine of the wind lifting the slates above me, until I think that God Himself has been blotted from the heavens of England by the witch&#x2019;s wind, and I will never hear Him again.<br>Finally, I get a letter from my husband at Coventry.<br><br><i>The king has commanded my presence and I fear he doubts me. He has sent for my son Lord Strange too, and was very dark when he learned that my son is from his home with an army of ten thousand men on the march, but my son has told nobody where he is going, and his servants only swear that he said he was raising his men for the true cause. I assure the king that my son will be marching to join us, loyal to the throne; but he has not yet arrived here at our command centre, in Coventry Castle.<br>Buckingham is trapped in Wales by the rising of the river Severn. Your son, I believe, will be held in port by the storm on the seas. The queen&#x2019;s men will be unable to march out on the drowned roads and the Duke of Norfolk is waiting for </i><i>them. I think your rebellion is over, you have been beaten by the rain and the rising of the waters. They are calling it the Duke of Buckingham&#x2019;s Water and it has washed him and his ambition to hell along with your hopes. Nobody has seen a storm like this since the Queen Elizabeth called up a mist to hide her husband&#x2019;s army at the battle of Barnet, or summoned snow for him at Tewkesbury. Nobody doubts she can do such a thing and most of us only hope she will stop before she washes us all away. But why? Can she be working against you now? And if so, why? Does she know, with her inner sight, what has befallen her boys and who has done it? Does she think you have done it? Is she drowning your son in revenge?<br>Destroy what papers you have kept, and deny whatever you have done. Richard is coming to London for his revenge and there will be a scaffold built on Tower Green. If he believes half what he has heard he will put you on it and I will be unable to save you.<br>Stanley.<br><br></i>OCTOBER 1483<br><br>I have been on my knees all night, but I don&#x2019;t know if God can hear me through the hellish noise of the rain. My son sets sail from Brittany with fifteen valuable ships and an army of five thousand men and loses them all in the storm at sea. Only two ships struggle ashore on the south coast and learn at once that Buckingham has been defeated by the rising of the river, his rebellion is washed away by the waters, and Richard is waiting, dry-shod, to execute the survivors.<br>My son turns his back on the country that should have been his, and sails for Brittany again, flying like a faintheart, leaving me here, unprotected, and clearly guilty of plotting his rebellion. We are parted once more, my heir and I, this time without even meeting, and this time it feels as if it is for ever. He and Jasper leave me to face the king, who marches vengefully on London like an invading enemy, mad with anger. Dr Lewis vanishes off to Wales, Bishop Morton takes the first ship that can sail after the storms and goes to France, Buckingham&#x2019;s men slip from the City in silence and under lowering skies, the queen&#x2019;s kin make their way to Brittany and to the tattered remains of my son&#x2019;s makeshift court, and my husband arrives in London in the train of King Richard, whose handsome face is dark with the sullen rage of a traitor betrayed. <br>&#x2018;He knows,&#x2019;my husband says shortly as he comes to my room, his travelling cape still around his shoulders, his sympathy scant. &#x2018;He knows you were working with the queen, and he will put you on trial. He has evidence from half a dozen witnesses. Rebels from Devon to East Anglia know your name and have letters from you.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Husband, surely he will not.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You are clearly guilty of treason and that is punishable by death.&#x2019; <br>&#x2018;But if he thinks you are faithful . . .&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I <i>am </i>faithful,&#x2019; he corrects me. &#x2018;It is not a matter of opinion but of fact. Not what the king thinks &#x2013; but what he can see. When Buckingham rode out, while you were summoning your son to invade England, and paying rebels, while the queen was raising the southern counties, I was at his side, advising him, loaning him money, calling out my own affinity to defend him, faithful as any northerner. He trusts me now as he has never done before. My son raised an army for him.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Your son&#x2019;s army was for me!&#x2019; I interrupt.<br>&#x2018;My son will deny that, I will deny that, we will call you a liar and nobody can prove anything, either way.&#x2019;<br>I pause. &#x2018;Husband, you will intercede for me?&#x2019;<br>He looks at me thoughtfully, as if the answer could be &#x2018;no&#x2019;.<br>&#x2018;Well, it is a consideration, Lady Margaret. My King Richard is bitter, he cannot believe that the Duke of Buckingham, his best friend, his only friend, should betray him. And you? He is astonished at your infidelity. You carried his wife&#x2019;s train at her coronation, you were her friend, you welcomed her to London. He feels you have betrayed him. Unforgiveably. He thinks you as faithless as your kinsman Buckingham; and Buckingham was executed on the spot.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Buckingham is dead?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;They took off his head in Salisbury market place. The king would not even see him. He was too angry with him and he is filled with hate towards you. You said that Queen Anne was welcome to her city, that she had been missed. You bowed the knee to him and wished him well. And then you sent out messages to every disaffected Lancastrian family in the country to tell them the cousins&#x2019; war had come again, and that this time you will win.&#x2019;<br>I grit my teeth. &#x2018;Should I run away?

In <i>To the Last Salute</i> we learn why. Trapp&#x2019;s own story of his exploits as a submarine commander during the First World War is as exciting as it is instructive, bringing to stirring life a little-known chapter in the naval history of that war.&nbsp;In his many guises Trapp describes life as captain of Austro-Hungarian U-boats in the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas, emerging by turn as the Imperial Austrian naval officer, the witty observer of international politics, and the indefatigable and ultimately heartbroken patriot opposing the Allied enemy. He relates deadly duels with submarine sweepers, narrow escapes and excruciatingly close calls, and the spectacular sinking of cargo and war ships&#x2014;all the while maintaining a keen sense of the camaraderie of seamen from every corner of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. A picture of a lost time, a portrait of a remarkable character, a window on early submarine warfare: Trapp&#x2019;s story, in English for the first time, offers a rare combination of human interest, historical insight, and true life-and-death adventure.</p><p>Elizabeth M.

From its origins as a trading company struggling to keep up with its superior Dutch, Portuguese, and Spanish competitors to its tenure as the ruling authority of the Indian subcontinent to its eventual hubristic downfall, the East India Company serves as a lens through which to explore the much larger economic and social forces that shaped the formation of a global British Empire. As a private company that became a non-state global power in its own right, the East India Company also serves as a cautionary tale all too relevant to the modern world&#x2019;s current political and economic situation. On its most basic level, the East India Company played an essential part in the development of long-distance trade between Britain and Asia. The trade in textiles, ceramics, tea, and other goods brought a huge influx of capital into the British economy. This not only fueled the Industrial Revolution, but also created a demand for luxury items amongst the middle classes. The economic growth provided by the East India Company was one factor in Britain&#x2019;s ascendancy from a middling regional power to the most powerful nation on the planet. The profits generated by the East India Company also created incentive for other European powers to follow its lead, which led to three centuries of competition for colonies around the world. This process went well beyond Asia to affect most of the planet, including Africa and the Middle East. Beyond its obvious influence in areas like trade and commerce, the East India Company also served as a point of cultural contact between Western Europeans, South Asians, and East Asians. Quintessentially British practices such as tea drinking were made possible by East India Company trade. The products and cultural practices traveling back and forth on East India Company ships from one continent to another also reconfigured the way societies around the globe viewed sexuality, gender, class, and labor. On a much darker level, the East India Company fueled white supremacy and European concepts of Orientalism (See Said, Orientalism). In the same vein, as a joint stock company, the East India Company left behind meticulous documentation of its economic exchanges and policies. Descriptions of military endeavors, encounters with indigenous peoples, and codes of conduct for employees also give contemporary researchers insight into the cultural perspectives of those who governed the company. Moreover, the East India Company&#x2019;s policies and personnel were the subject of frequent commentaries in newspapers, parliamentary debates, and other publicly available sources. Historians have used these detailed records to reconstruct both the day-to-day operations and the larger historical arc of the company. In addition, the sources created by the East India Company provide insight into the far less well-documented histories of the people the East India Company encountered, traded with, and ultimately conquered. One of the major reasons that the East India Company remains the subject of intense interest is that the consequences of its influence remain visible in India, Britain, and other parts of the world to this day. While the British Crown eventually replaced the East India Company as the governing authority of India, the systems of production they had established remained intact. More than half a century after India declared independence from the British Empire, the economic and cultural effects of this colonial system of production remained apparent. The disparities in wealth and power between the Global North and the Global South may not stem from the East India Company alone, but the company played an indisputable role in imperial processes.</p><p></p><h2>The Washington Stratagem: A Yael Azoulay Novel (Yael Azoulay Series, 2)</h2><p><p>In this action-packed, suspenseful sequel to the international thriller <em>The Geneva Option,</em> U.N. covert negotiator Yael Azoulay is drawn into a web of betrayal and intrigue that leads from deep within America&#x2019;s military-industrial complex to the Middle East and beyond.</p><p>Yael Azoulay nearly lost her life while on assignment for the United Nations in the Congo.

This unabashedly biased multibillion-dollar communications empire disregards journalistic ethics and universal standards of fairness and accuracy, manufacturing "news" that is often bought and paid for by a tight network of corporate-backed foundations and old family fortunes. By dissecting the appeal, techniques, and reach of the booming right-wing media market, Brock demonstrates that it is largely based on bigotry, ignorance, and emotional manipulation closely tied to America&#x2019;s longstanding cultural divisions and the buying power of anti-intellectual traditionalists. <br><br>From the disputed 2000 presidential election to the war with Iraq to the political battles of 2004, Brock's penetrating analysis of right-wing media theories and methodology reveals that the Republican Right views the media as an extension of a broader struggle for political power. By tracing the political impact of right-wing media, Brock shows how disproportionate conservative influence in the media is integrally linked to the Republican Right&#x2019;s current domination of all three branches of government, to the propping up of the Bush administration, and to the inability of Democrats to voice their opposition to this political sea change or to compete on an even playing field.<br><br>As only an ex-conservative intimately familiar with the imperatives of the American right wing could, David Brock suggests ways in which concerned Americans can begin to redress the conservative ascendancy and cut through the propagandistic fog. Writing with verve and deep insight, he reaches far beyond typical bromides about media bias to produce an invaluable account of the rise of right-wing media and its political consequences. Promising to be the political book of the year, <b>The Republican Noise Machine</b> will transform the raging yet heretofore unsatisfying debate over the politics of the media for years to come.</p><p>DAVID BROCK is the author of four books, including <b>Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative</b>, a New York Times bestselling political memoir.

After a presidential election decided by the Supreme Court, the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, and the war with Iraq, politics has moved to a different place.<br><br>Nowadays, when I talk about <i>Blinded by the Right,</i> people want to know not how I was blinded by the Right, but how so much of the country seems to be in that position. For the first time since 1929, the Republican Party controls all three branches of government. Fewer people identify with the Democratic Party today than at any time since the New Deal. Conservatism seems the prevailing political and intellectual current, while liberalism seems a fringe dispensation of a few aging professors and Hollywood celebrities. People ask me, a former insider, how the Republican Right <br>has won political and ideological power with such seeming ease and why Democrats, despite winning the most votes in the last three presidential elections, seem to be caught in a downward spiral, still able to win at the ballot box but steadily losing the battle for hearts and minds.<br><br>While it is not the only answer, my answer is: It&#x2019;s the media, stupid.<br><br>When I say this, in a more respectful way, to folks outside the right wing, I usually get either of two responses. Those who receive their news from <br>the<i> New York Times</i> and National Public Radio give me blank stares. They are living in a rarefied media culture&#x2014;one that prizes accuracy, fairness, and civility&#x2014;that is no longer representative of the media as a whole. Those who have heard snippets of Rush Limbaugh&#x2019;s radio show, have caught a glimpse of Bill O&#x2019;Reilly&#x2019;s temper tantrums on the FOX News Channel, or occasionally peruse the editorials in the<i> Wall Street Journal</i> think I&#x2019;m a Cassandra. They view this media as self-discrediting and therefore irrelevant. They are living in a vacuum of denial.<br><br>Those who understand what I mean are either members of the media itself, have read media-criticism books or Internet sites devoted to the subject, or are in the political trenches every day dealing with the media. The gap between those who recognize right-wing media power for what it is and those who don&#x2019;t is wide and deep, as if they inhabit parallel universes. The gap is dangerous to democracy and needs to be closed.<br><br>When I came to Washington fresh out of college in 1986, I got a job at the <i>Washington Times,</i> the right-wing newspaper bankrolled by Reverend Sun Myung Moon, the Korean-born leader of a religious cult called the Unification Church. Though Moon&#x2019;s paper was said to be read in the Reagan White House, nobody paid much attention to it. We were the proverbial voice in the wilderness. Considering that the paper was governed by a calculatedly unfair political bias and that its journalistic ethics were close to nil, this was a good thing. That was eighteen years ago. Today, the most important sectors of the political media&#x2014;most of cable TV news, the majority of popular op-ed columns, almost all of talk radio, a substantial chunk of the book market, and many of the most highly trafficked Web sites&#x2014;reflect more closely the political and journalistic values of the <i>Washington Times</i> than those of the<i> New York Times.<br><br></i>That is, they are powerful propaganda organs of the Republican Party. For our politics, this development in the media represents a structural change: a structural advantage for the GOP and conservatism, and, I believe, the greatest structural obstacle facing opponents of the right wing. I therefore think it is one of the most important political stories of the era. I have sought to tell this story in <i>The Republican Noise Machine: Right-Wing Media and How It Corrupts Democracy.<br><br></i>I know there is a Republican Noise Machine because I was once part of it. From the <i>Washington Times,</i> to a stint as a &#x201c;research fellow&#x201d; at the Heritage Foundation (the Right&#x2019;s premier think tank), to a position as an &#x201c;investigative writer&#x201d; at the muckraking magazine <i>The American Spectator,</i> and as the author of a best-selling right-wing book, I forwarded the right-wing agenda not as an open political operative or advocate but under the guise of journalism and punditry, fueled by huge sums of money from right-wing billionaires, foundations, and self-interested corporations.<br><br>By the time I said good-bye to the right wing in 1997, what was once a voice in the wilderness was drowning out competing voices across all media channels. The most influential political commentator in America, Rush Limbaugh, and his hundreds of imitators saturated every media market in the country, providing 22 percent of Americans&#x2014;not only conservatives <br>but independent swing voters&#x2014;with their primary source of news. Conservatives had changed the face of the cable news business with the establishment of the top-rated FOX News Channel, a slicker broadcast version of the Moonie <i>Washington Times.</i> Pundit Ann Coulter and her fanatical ilk topped the best-seller lists, becoming superstars in the world of political punditry. The <i>Spectator</i> juggernaut&#x2014;which had a circulation of three hundred thousand per month at its height in the early 1990s&#x2014;had been replaced by Internet gossip Matt Drudge, who gets more than 6.5 million visitors to his site every day. Although enormous subsidies were still being pumped into right-wing media that did not turn a profit, right-wing media also had become a multibillion-dollar business, a development that powerfully affected all other commercial media.<br><br>The lies, smears, and vicious caricatures leveled against Bill and Hillary Clinton by this right-wing media, and then repeated in virtually every media venue in the country, have now been well documented, not least in <i>Blinded by the Right.</i> In that book, I compared the anti-Clinton propaganda to a virus as it seeped off the pages of the <i>Spectator</i> into the minds of every sentient American. My memoir ended in 2000; what I did not fully comprehend then, but what is apparent to me now as I have watched the politics of the last few years unfold, is that the virus was not Clinton-specific. In fact, it had nothing to do with the Clintons per se; rather, in different strains, it would afflict any and every political opponent of the right wing, including Al Gore, Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, and the mourners of Senator Paul Wellstone, every major Democrat seeking the presidency in 2004, <i>New York Times</i> columnist Paul Krugman, and the liberal advocacy group MoveOn.org. What we have here, as a criminal investigator might say, is a pattern.<br><br>In the 2000 presidential campaign, the Republican Noise Machine, which worked for years to convince Americans that the Clintons were criminally minded, used the same techniques of character assassination to turn the Democratic standard-bearer, Al Gore, for many years seen as an overly earnest Boy Scout, into a liar. When Republican National Committee polling showed that the Republicans would lose the election to the Democrats on the issues, a &#x201c;skillful and sustained 18-month campaign by Republicans to portray the vice president as flawed and untrustworthy&#x201d; was adopted, the<i> New York Times</i> reported. Republicans accused Gore of saying things he never said&#x2014;most infamously, that he &#x201c;invented&#x201d; the Internet, a claim he never made that was first attributed to him in a GOP press release before it coursed through the media. Actually, Gore had said, &#x201c;During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet,&#x201d; a claim that even former House Speaker Newt Gingrich verified as true.1<br><br>The right-wing media broadcast this attack and similar attacks relentlessly, in effect giving the GOP countless hours of free political advertising every day for months leading up to the election. &#x201c;Albert Arnold Gore Jr. is a habitual liar,&#x201d; William Bennett, a Cabinet secretary in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, announced in the editorial pages of the<i> Wall Street Journal.</i> &#x201c;...Gore lies because he can&#x2019;t help himself,&#x201d; neoconservative pamphleteer David Horowitz wrote. &#x201c;liar, liar,&#x201d; screamed Rupert Murdoch&#x2019;s <i>New York Post.</i> The conservative columnist George F. Will pointed to Gore&#x2019;s &#x201c;serial mendacity&#x201d; and warned that he is a &#x201c;dangerous man.&#x201d; &#x201c;Gore may be quietly going nuts,&#x201d; <i>National Review</i>&#x2019;s Byron York concluded. The <i>Washington Times</i> agreed: &#x201c;The real question is how to react to Mr. Gore&#x2019;s increasingly bizarre utterings. <i>Webster&#x2019;s New World Dictionary</i> defines &#x2018;delusion&#x2019; thusly: &#x2018;The apparent perception, in a nervous or mental disorder, of some thing external that is not actually present...a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality, resulting from deception, misconception, or a mental disorder.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>This impugning of Gore&#x2019;s character and the questioning of his mental fitness soon surfaced in the regular media. The<i> New York Times</i> ran an article headlined tendency to embellish fact snags gore, while the <i>Boston Globe</i> weighed in with gore seen as &#x201c;misleading.&#x201d; On ABC&#x2019;s <i>This Week,</i> former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos referred to Gore&#x2019;s &#x201c;Pinocchio problem.&#x201d; For <i>National Journal</i>&#x2019;s Stuart Tay...</p><h2>The Human Body: A Fascinating See-Through View of How Our Bodies Work</h2><p>Transparencies depicting the organs of the human body are accompanied by a text introducing the skin, muscles, skeleton, lungs, circulatory system, and other systems, and telling how each part works.</p><p></p><h2>Under the Black Flag: The Romance and the Reality of Life Among the Pirates</h2><p>For this rousing, revisionist history, the former head of exhibitions at England&#39;s National Maritime Museum has combed original documents and records to produce a most authoritative and definitive account of piracy&#39;s &#34;Golden Age.&#34; As he explodes many accepted myths (i.e. &#34;walking the plank&#34; is pure fiction), Cordingly replaces them with a truth that is more complex and often bloodier. 16 pp. of photos. Maps.</p><p>Though literature, films, and folklore have romanticized pirates as gallant seaman who hunted for treasure in exotic locales, David Cordingly, a former curator at the National Maritime Museum in England, reveals the facts behind the legends of such outlaws as Captain Kidd, Blackbeard, and Calico Jack. Even stories about buried treasure are fictitious, he says, yet still the myth remains. Though pirate captains were often sadistic villains and crews endured barbarous tortures, were constantly threatened with the possibility of death by hanging, drowning in a storm, or surviving a shipwreck on a hostile coast, pirates are still idealized. Cordingly examines why the myth of the romance of piratehood endures and why so few lived out their days in luxury on the riches they had plundered.<b>David Cordingly </b>was for 12 years on the staff of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England, where he was curator of paintings and then head of exhibitions.

Early users of tobacco in Russia would have their noses cut off and repeat offenders their heads. Pope Innocent XII excommunicated any who used it in St. Peters. Marijuana users in 14th century Egypt would have their teeth extracted for the crime. Yet use of these and other forbidden substances continued to grow. If only as a record of the perennial failure of harsh punishments to deter drug use Victorian naturalist Mordecai Cooke&#39;s work The Seven Sisters of Sleep would remain significant. But Cooke&#39;s natural humor and keen insights have ensured this work&#39;s reputation as possibly the best early book from what has grown into an enormous body of literature on mind- and mood-altering substances.

She joined Bretton Hall College of the Arts in 1990, leading the renowned teacher training course and teaching BA and MA textile design. Her great passion is embroidered textiles and she has been a regional mentor for the Embroiderers&#39; Development Scheme and Chair of the Textile Society. She currently lectures at the University of Leeds. She regularly publishes articles and is a member of the Practical Study Group. She lives in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.It is far, far better that a book on any aesthetic endeavor be filled with a multiplicity of color photographs and illustrations, accompanied by a minimum of words. British embroiderer teacher Greenlees ignores all that, although samples do inhabit every page. Her approach is at first brain centered, giving definitions, imparting a sense of purpose, and explaining the variety of contents possible. Once a reason for being has been established for the sketchbook, she explores a number of different routes--using samples, incorporating models, going on location, working in a museum, even surfing on a computer--all, of course, coupled with intriguing, wondrous pages from European textilists. The rest of her elongated essay is devoted to technical information--materials, coloring, and mark-making methods--as well as decisions on what the actual sketchbook should look like. Store bought or handmade? Even more important is the message: just do it. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

If I swept it one way with the palm of my hand, it almost blended in. I could squint and forget it was even there, but then a swipe in the other direction, and the stain reappeared, darker than I remembered, like I&#x2019;d just fed it.</p><p>Everyone had a different story about the stain. Simone said I&#x2019;d pissed the couch as a toddler, after running free from our mother&#x2019;s bundle of towels, just out of my bath. &#x201c;You went straight for the couch, stood right there on the armrest, grabbed your half- inch wang, and aimed,&#x201d; Simone said. &#x201c;I saw it, and Aurore and Jeremie, we never understood what came over you, Dory. It&#x2019;s like you were on a mission.&#x201d;</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t, indeed, sound like me at all. First, the number of decisions that was implied, all of them transgressing my mother&#x2019;s law (running naked and barefoot on the cold living room tile, grabbing my penis in public, pissing on the couch). Add to that Simone's choice of words: <i>went straight, aimed, mission. </i>Hers was the least believable story. Aurore and Jeremie didn't even back it up.</p><p>Other stories of the stain incriminated my siblings in turn: coffee stain (Berenice), nail polish (Aurore), jism (]eremie), to�mato sauce (Leonard), paint (Simone). Each initial stain was, in every account, made worse by our mother's attempt to clean it with unfit detergent. One story was actually based on the prem�ise that there had been no stain to get rid of in the first place, that our zealous mother had just wanted to bring a new shine to the couch and had ruined it with a single spray of the wrong thing.</p><p>The stain on the couch made me uneasy. It made me think I was the only one to notice things, to care. "Why do you care so much about the stain?" my mother once asked, and the thing is, I couldn't understand why no one else did.</p><p>I loved my family, I believe. Even though I'd known no other and couldn't really tell, I thought they were all right, decent people. But oblivious. They got lost in their thoughts. They had no sense of the other-of anyone outside our family, sometimes even me.</p><p>One point every story of the stain converged on: the stain was at the very least nine years old. That was a long time to keep a stained couch, I thought. We were not poor.</p><p>~</p><p>I knew we weren't poor because we went to the beach every summ�er, and I'd learned in school (fourth grade) that being able to go to the beach was a privilege not everyone had. There had been a national campaign to raise awareness of children who didn't get to go away at all during summer. Our teacher, Miss Faux, had shown us clips of kids seeing the ocean for the very first time thanks to the money collected the previous year by the Let Them Sea charity. Some of the kids in the Let Them Sea videos hadn't even believed the sea existed before. They thought it was just a fairy-tale word, "like magic wands, or castles," one of them told the camera. Some of them were older than me. I remember one girl in the video-her name was Juliette, the caption said who'd looked more happy about her little brother's walking on beach for the first time than about her own discovery. She kept looking at him, his reactions. She barely glanced at the water herself. It had made me teary eyed a bit. After the clips, Miss Faux had put a tin jar with the Let Them Sea logo on her desk and encouraged us to put whatever we could in it, even just a penny or a dime. It was important, she'd said, that we realized that the smallest of our sacrifices could make a big difference in another kid's life. A couple of the boys in my class had lied and said they didn't get pocket money at all and sadly could not donate to the cause. During break, though, I'd heard them talk about all the candy they'd buy later, and why should they pay for poor people' vacations anyway, and how those of us who gave money were suckers who fell into the guilt trap like shit into the toilet bowl I'd put the whole of my monthly allowance in the Let Them Sea jar. I had waited for a moment where Miss Faux would see how much I tossed in, but either she didn't pay attention or she didn't think my generosity was worth commenting on.</p><p>~</p><p>At home, I was always first at the dinner table. My siblings would come down the stairs only at our mother's insistence, and then like drops from a leaking faucet, one at a time, at painful inter�vals. I had to wait for them all to get there to start eating.</p><p>"The father won't be coming back tonight," my mother said one evening as she and I were waiting for the others. I thought she meant he was dead, but he'd only been kept abroad by a con�ference and had missed his connecting flight home. She called him "the father" to give him extra substance, I thought. We saw him so little.</p><p>Mom ate from blue plates and bowls because she'd read that blue tableware cut your appetite, and she always wanted to lose four pounds. That night, she'd made whitefish, and whitefish you could eat as much as you wanted and not gain an ounce, she said, but still she'd set a blue plate in front of her.</p><p>"The father won't be coming home tonight," she repeated to Simone, then Jeremie, then Leonard, as each showed up. No one asked for details.</p><p>Aurore was particularly hard to lure downstairs at the time, or to even see outside of her bedroom. She studied permanently. She and Berenice were both writing PhD dissertations, on different subjects and in different cities. Berenice lived in Paris and didn't come back home too often.</p><p>"Will someone see if Aurore plans to eat with us tonight?" my mother asked, and she was looking at me.</p><p>"Aurore," I said through her door.</p><p>"Is this a life-or-death matter?" Aurore asked.</p><p>"It's dinnertime," I said. "We're all waiting for you." "Don't," she said. "I can't be interrupted right now."</p><p>"Do you want me to bring up a plate for you?" "You're an angel, Dory."</p><p>When I went to bed that night, Aurore still hadn't touched the whitefish and potatoes on the tray I'd left outside her door. The potatoes had started turning purple-gray. I ate a couple. I wasn't even hungry.</p><p>Sometimes, Mom hooked me up with a blue plate too.</p><p>~</p><p>Every August, Berenice came home from Paris and our parent put the six of us in the van and crammed suitcases in between our seats and at our feet. The van had no trunk. We used the suitcase as ottomans and armrests. The drive to the beach was about three hours, and we usually listened to the traffic news radio station the whole way. It was pretty repetitive, but at least when they played music between bulletins, it was songs we all knew, which my mother thought was nice-not that we sang along to them or anything. It brought the generations together.</p><p>I don't know why we went to that beach every summer. I don&#x2019;t think anyone had particular affection for it. None of my three sisters would leave our bungalow (the same one every year) before five p.m.-they were all very light skinned and feared getting sunburned-and when they did go out, it was only to keep doing what they'd been doing indoors, which was reading or when their eyes got tired, talking to each other about what they' read. Leonard looked at people and took notes all day. Jeremie liked digging holes in the sand and lying down at the bottom of them. Summer after summer, the holes got deeper. At some point, it became impossible for Jeremie to get himself out of the holes without outside help, but he didn't seem to mind. He knew someone would come check on him eventually. He just liked to lie there on his back and look at that rectangle of sky he'd framed for himself, and once, when our mother informed him he could lie on the beach with her and me, at sea level, and see exactly as much sky, more sky, even, she believed, Jeremie agreed with her but added that he would also have to see a bunch of strangers in bathing suits.</p><p>The father and I were the only ones to actually go in the sea. He swam while I threw myself at oncoming waves, not too far from the shore, waiting for him to swim back to me. That's as close as I could get to sharing something with him, even though I was scared to go far out like he did. I wasn't exactly sure what the father did for a living but he did it away from us. Germany, China, Spain. Some sort of engineering. When teachers in school asked what our fathers' jobs were, I said mine traveled, and it seemed to be accepted as a valid occupation. Like any kid whose father didn't have a cool-sounding job, I assume, I hoped that mine was actually a spy. It had to happen sometimes that these fantasies turned out to be true, and I believed my chances were in fact higher than other kids' because my father traveled abroad a lot, so there was, at least, potential for covert missions and se�crets, whereas the spydom of other fathers was unlikely, given that they worked in town, where nothing much ever happened.</p><p>We didn't see the father much, but when we did, on week�ends, or in the summer, it seemed he couldn't wait to get away from us again. He swam a little farther every day. I'm not making that up to sound dramatic or anything. He did have this device he wrapped around his wrist that measured his progress, and he would announce a new record distance to us each morning.</p><p>My siblings loved swimming at the pool back home. They were all great swimmers and had bodies that proved it, athletic and lean, but the idea of swimming in the sea disgusted them. My mother claimed she couldn't swim, and it worried me. I wanted her to learn. "What would happen if I started to drown?" I'd ask. "Would you just watch me <i>die?" </i>She'd say that if I drowned probably one of my siblings would go in the water to help me out She'd always rush the pronunciation of the <i>probably, </i>but never once did she forget to say it.</p><p>Simone was the one who disliked summer holidays the most My other siblings were already in college or grad school, so I didn't really make a difference to them where we were: they always had "research" to work on. But Simone still needed to be assigned work, and was of the opinion that school breaks were a waste of time. She'd skipped any number of grades over the years (she was only thirteen, a year and a half older than me and already in high school) but she would've done the rest of her curriculum nonstop if that had been an option. She always got strangely nostalgic, though, when the time came to pack the car and go back home. Any other time, she was fine being in the middle, but she demanded a window seat for the ride back. She said looking at the seashore fade away through the window was good way to get a grasp on her melancholy, and that being able to pull from a store of melancholy was what made great artists. "Car trips make great artists?" I asked, making sure I understood what my sister had said. "Car trips <i>back," </i>Simone specified.</p><p>The summer after I found out about kids who never got to see the ocean, I tried to be less bored, to look around me through their eyes and be amazed like I'd seen them be in that video. I found it hard to marvel at the water, though, and the waves, without encouragement. I wondered if a person needed to be looked at while enjoying something in order for that person to really enjoy it, and whether that was why that girl Juliette had only been looking at her little brother looking at the sea when they both saw it for the first time-to make sure he understood he had to enjoy it. I watched Simone being melancholy all the way home, but it didn't seem like she needed an audience.</p><p>~</p><p>My parents didn't look very much in love to me, and I thought it was my fault. I guess it's what happens when you're the only one to notice a thing: you feel responsible for it. They didn't really kiss, just a dry smack on the lips in the mornings when the father left for somewhere. They only seemed to exchange practical information about appointments or taxes, sometimes us. I thought they were waiting until I was old enough to move away to get a divorce.</p><p>~</p><p>I once went a whole week without seeing Aurore. Our bedrooms faced one another, but she rarely left hers. When she had to, for mandatory family dinners (one birthday or another), she looked out of place. I won't say much about our house because I'm really bad at picturing three-dimensional spaces, let alone describing them. I could never tell whose bedroom was the one right over our kitchen, for instance. I'm not good at drawing either. But basically: we had a living room, a kitchen, and a dining room we never ate in on the first floor, and then four bedrooms and on bathroom upstairs. I shared a bedroom with Simone. My parents&#x2019; was next door. My brothers' and Aurore's were across the hall from us.</p><p>I missed Aurore's bedroom. When I was smaller and she was writing less important papers for school, she'd let me sit under her desk for hours. It was a panel desk, so I was enclosed on three sides. The fourth side opened onto Aurore, who worked with her legs up and folded half-lotus. All I saw of her was knees and bare feet, and I had all the space beneath the desk to myself. She never asked what I was doing under there. She had total respect for my privacy. I was so silent she sometimes forgot about me, though. She'd start stretching her legs for blood flow and I'd say, "Hey!&#x201d; and she'd apologize and fold her legs back up.</p><p>Most of the time, I did nothing at all under there. I'd started drawing a mural in Crayola on the underside of the desk, but I only worked on it sporadically. I could never really see what I was drawing anyway, it was so dark. One day I started adding boogers to the mural, for texture. I felt guilty about it, but couldn't stop.</p><p>When Aurore decided I'd gotten too big to sit under her desk it hurt. I begged for one last afternoon, mainly so I could scrap off all the dried boogers from the mural. At the end of the day Aurore could tell I was sad and she said, "I'll get a bigger desk for us one of these days," but she never did.</p><p>~</p><p>I believed if I ran away from home, it would make my mother happy. She always complained we weren't adventurous enough, and while my siblings usually met her remark with the same in� difference they granted statements of personal opinions in gen�eral, I, the youngest of the six of us, took it to heart. I didn't want to be blamed for the others' quirks. I wanted to be my own man. To be different. I mean, I had no choice but to be different (I wasn't as smart or as good-looking as my brothers and sisters), but I had no particular idea what kind of person I should be ei�ther. I thought I could at least try what my mother had in mind and be adventurous.</p><p>It was unclear, though, what an adventure was. Jeremie, the younger of my brothers, had been offered chances to tour Eu�rope with two different philharmonics: those would've been adventures, according to our mother, if Jeremie hadn't declined both opportunities, stating he preferred keeping cello a hobby. But when my other brother, Leonard, had begged my parents to let him go spend the tenth and following grades in boarding school, my mother hadn't thought it qualified as adventure, even though Leonard had tried hard to sell it as such. He'd said board�ing school w...</p></p><h2>Agricultural Marketing System</h2><p>Custom edition for University of Missouri</p><p></p><h2>The Dawn Horse Testament of Heart-Master Da Free John</h2><p>Here are some highlights from an important new work by Master Da Free John with important information about the book an its author.</p><p></p><h2>Southern Comfort: The Garden District of New Orleans, 1800-1900</h2><p>This pioneering study of the opulent Garden District of New Orleans is a fascinating and entertaining account of how immigrant merchants and craftsmen from throughout the United States and abroad combined efforts to create one of America's first and most elegant suburbs, a lavish and enduring symbol of southern comfort in the Victorian era.<br> <br> <i>Southern Comfort</i> is the first study of New Orleans to relate economic and social movements to the architectural face of the city, unveiling the process by which a predominantly Yankee suburb became a profoundly southern community Using New Orleans' unique notarial archive - a detailed written record of issues relating to real estate and architecture there - Starr skillfully creates an active interchange with the people who built the District.<br> <br> Starr introduces the architects, builders, craftsmen, servants, and retainers and recounts the colorful details of their lives.

They expected to die there and even brought along a yellow dog&#x2014;which, according to our beliefs, would guide them through the Nine Hells after death.</p><p>I was sixteen years old.</p><p>I will tell you more of the Nine Hells, the Mystery City, and Yellow Dog in a moment, but first let me introduce myself. My name is Mazatl&#x2014;which means &#x201c;Deer&#x201d; in the Aztec tongue, Nahuatl&#x2014;and Mazatl is the name I have always answered to in our village. By law, however, I must have a Spanish name, and in their language I am called Juan Rios.</p><p>The Spanish call all indios &#x201c;Aztecs,&#x201c; which many of my people resent. In the Spaniards&#x2019; minds, slaves are beneath contempt, and we indios are indeed enslaved. Few Spaniards acknowledge that we have had a culture rich in art, architecture, medicine, and astronomy and that our culture thrived long before they arrived and destroyed our towering monuments to the majesty of the past. Nor has it occurred to these people whose roots are in Europe that people of the Americas did not need to be &#x201c;discovered.&#x201d;</p><p>In truth, however, I am heir to an even older and mightier people than the Mexica, the first people whom the Spanish condescendingly call Aztec: I am of the Toltec, a civilization that scholars call the first true &#x201c;Aztec&#x201d; because those civilizations that followed&#x2014;the Mexica-Aztecs, Mayan, Zapotec, and all the others&#x2014;shamelessly aped Toltec civilization in their art and architecture, most notably in the construction of their own cities and in the rendering of their .nest artworks.</p><p>Like the Mexica-Aztecs and other empires in central Mexico, the Toltec speak Nahuatl&#x2014;the melodious tongue of the gods.</p><p>My people were a mighty empire when the Mexica-Aztec, the People of the Reed, wandered naked and defenseless, the prey of snakes and crocodiles, jaguars and wolves, living on grubs and weeds and worms. These uncouth savages feared our fury and lusted after our prodigious riches&#x2014;all the while trembling before our soaring pyramids and illimitable empire. Most of all they stared in awestruck wonder at our Scintillating City of Turquoise Gold, our Invincible Citadel and Sacred Shrine&#x2014;Tula. To the Aztec, Tula was a city of golden turquoise-laden palaces, where meat, maize, beans, avocados, and honeyed sweets were plentiful as earth and air, where mescal, corn beer, and fermented chocolate .owed like water.</p><p>Perhaps most of all, the Aztec envied our science and our skill with numbers. To them our learning must have indeed seemed inscrutable as the sun and stars. Rather than working fields, the people of Tula probed the heavens and through their celestial science and godlike wisdom divined the future.</p><p>My Toltec ancestors raised wondrous plants&#x2014;which cured all the ills that human flesh is heir to. Erecting vertiginous temples and magnificent monuments, we even placated the implacable gods.</p><p>Aztec emperors would later claim lineal descent from Tula&#x2019;s royalty, while its high nobility truckled after Toltec wives.</p><p>Now all that remained of Tula&#x2019;s golden grandeur was shards and slivers, wrack and ruin&#x2014;the centuries-ravaged wreckage of a five-tiered step-pyramid dedicated to Quetzalcoatl; cracked, crumbling foundations of other toppled temples; ruins of two ball courts, and the scattered, shattered remains of a Sun King&#x2019;s grandiose palace.</p><p>The terraces of the step-pyramid&#x2019;s sloping sides were still embellished with painted and sculpted friezes of marching jaguars and ferocious dogs, of birds of prey devouring human hearts, and of human faces, trapped and staring wild-eyed inside the gaping jaws of serpents.</p><p>No, nothing before or since had equaled the Toltec&#x2014;including the Mexica. Ignorant of art and architecture, the Mexica ransacked the culture of my people. When building their own great city, Tenochtitl�n, they pillaged Tula&#x2019;s religion, culture, art&#x2014;even the concept of themselves as warrior-priests of the sun god. Thus most &#x201c;Aztec&#x201d; myths, legends, their pantheon of gods, pictographs, temples, and palaces were imitations of our own culture, our infinite creativity.</p><p>Even now the grandeur of our lost Toltec world could be felt&#x2014;despite the barbarism of the Spanish. Indio ruins throughout the colony were shaped to resemble Toltec edifices, including those of the magnificent Chich�n Itz� monuments in the land of the Maya to the far south.</p><p>Ayyo... Tula had been a great empire a thousand years before I was born&#x2014;though now it was only an abandoned ruin. The city, however, was not abandoned by the gods of my people&#x2014;I sensed their presence the moment I reached the pyramid&#x2019;s summit and walked among the forest of giant stone warriors now known as the Atlanteans, a name drawn from the legend of the lost continent of Atlantis rather than the history of my people because no one knows the true name of these mighty warriors.</p><p>These fierce stone warriors, standing nearly three times the height of a man, evoked visions of great wars and conquest by a people far superior to those that walk the land today.</p><p>I have lived my entire life in a village in the mountains to the east of Tula. The village is small, fewer than a hundred huts and not really big enough to support a church, though we had our own small chapel. It was said that our village was so small and poor that only priests being punished for transgressions against God and the Church were sent there.</p><p>No Spaniards lived in the village except for the priest, and as would be expected for a man sent to purgatory on earth, he was neither a very good Spaniard nor a very devout priest.</p><p>Mexico City was two long days&#x2019; walk to the south. I had never been to the great city, though I had heard many tales of its savage wrath and majestic wonder.</p><p>The people of my village subsisted on the maize and beans and peppers we grew. We also mined a sulfur pit in a nearby mountainside.</p><p>My people did not grow rich off the sulfur. Unlike gold or silver, it is not precious. There would be a time when we used the sulfur as an ingredient in black powder, but we never profited from the sale of the black powder.</p><p>In the end, however, that damnable gunpowder doomed my uncles&#x2014;and had forced our journey to Tula to fight our last battle.</p><p>Excerpted from AZTEC FIRE by ROBERT GLEASON AND JUNIUS PODRUG</p><p><br>Copyright � 2008 by Eugene Winick, Executor Estate of Gary Jennings</p><p><br>Published in April 2009 by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC</p><p>All rights reserved.

The story is told, chapter by chapter, from the perspectives of an eclectic array of characters. Former actress Elfrida--not very good by her own admission--leaves London for a geriatric bolthole in the country where she meets retired schoolmaster and organist, Oscar. Meanwhile, Carrie (Elfrida's second cousin), returns to London from Austria where she had a brilliant career in the tourist industry, only to find her niece, 14-year-old Lucy, sadly neglected by her selfish mother and equally spoiled grandmother. Finally, handsome Sam is recalled from New York by his company chairman to revive an ailing Scottish textile mill. <p> As one character after another must learn to live with their losses, they find themselves collectively spirited northwards, from Sussex to Scotland, by way of Cornwall. And, as events unfurl, slowly, surely, but inevitably, those in need find solace in unexpected places. While her characterizations are generally carefully crafted and entirely rounded, Pilcher's greatest strengths lie in her natural, easy narratives of everyday life and her thoroughly researched and captivating descriptions of scenery and surroundings. <i>--Carey Green</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Introducing Postmodernism</h2><p>Traces the pedigrees of postmodernism in art, theory and history, and takes us on a roller-coaster ride through structuralism, semiotics and deconstruction in the company of postmodern icons such as Foucault, Levi-Strauss, Barthes, Derrida, Lacan and Lyotard.

It was unusual on five separate counts that are so obvious that they are usually missed. It was unusual in that it was a series of actions, not a single battle. It was unusual as a naval battle in that it was fought over five days; historically, naval battles have seldom spread themselves over more than one or two days. It was unusual in terms of its name. This battle involved a series of related actions subsequently grouped together under the name of just one of these engagements, but in fact none of the actions were fought inside Leyte Gulf.... More importantly, it was unusual in that it was a full-scale fleet action fought after the issue of victory and defeat at sea had been decided, and it was unusual in that it resulted in clear, overwhelming victory and defeat." &#x2014;from Chapter One</p><p>The Battle of Leyte Gulf&#x2014;October 22-28, 1944&#x2014;was the greatest naval engagement in history. In fact the battle was four separate actions, none of which were fought in the Gulf itself, and the result was the destruction of Japanese naval power in the Pacific. This book is a detailed and comprehensive account of the fighting from both sides. It provides the context of the battle, most obviously in terms of Japanese calculations and the search for "a fitting place to die" and "the chance to bloom as flowers of death." Using Japanese material never previously noted in western accounts, H.P. Willmott provides new perspectives on the unfolding of the battle and very deliberately seeks to give readers a proper understanding of the importance of this battle for American naval operations in the following month. This careful interrogation of the accounts of "the last fleet action" is a significant contribution to military history.</p></p><p>Winner, 2006 Society for Military History Distinguished Book Award<p>H. P. Willmott has written extensively on warfare in general and the Second World War in particular. Among his books are Empires in the Balance; The Barrier and the Javelin; The Great Crusade (a military reinterpretation of the Second World War); Grave of a Dozen Schemes: British Naval Planning and the War against Japan, 1943&#x2013;1945; and When Men Lost Faith in Reason: Reflections on Warfare in the Twentieth Century.

Christmas was nine days away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was reaching for her cell when the home phone rang.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nobody ever called the home number. She&#x2019;d threatened to have it disconnected so many times that it was now a standing joke in the Hawthorne family. Because she never had time to do anything she threatened to do, until now.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Hawthorne?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes. Her hand shaking as she cradled the receiver. A man&#x2019;s voice, unfamiliar.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nora hadn&#x2019;t thought her heart could climb any farther up her throat than it had in recent weeks. But it could, it turned out, it could.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When Nora and her sister, Marianne, were young, growing up in Narragansett, Rhode Island, they used to play a game. One of them would say to the other: A genie grants you three wishes. What would you wish for?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They would say things like: I wish all the appliances in the house would turn to chocolate. Or: I wish I could have the gift of flight for twenty-four hours. Or: I wish we had pizza for dinner every night for three weeks. When they got older, they might say: I wish Jennifer Johnson would get&nbsp;a really bad perm that lasted for the rest of the school year. Or: I wish my breasts would grow (Nora) or stop growing (Marianne).<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Hawthorne?<br> Yes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Sergeant Stephen Campbell, California State Highway&nbsp;Patrol.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephen. Such an ordinary name, Nora would think later, for such an extraordinary phone call.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three wishes, Genie, rapid-fire.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One. Say what you have to say, quickly.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two. Tell me it&#x2019;s going to be okay.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three. Let me go back to the beginning and start over.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Hawthorne. I&#x2019;m in the security office at the Golden Gate Bridge.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;<i>what</i>?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know how to get here, Mrs. Hawthorne?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She couldn&#x2019;t say another thing. The room was whirling. She sat down on one of the kitchen stools.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen carefully, please. I&#x2019;m going to tell you how to get here, and I want you to come right away. Do you understand me? We&#x2019;re on the south side of the bridge. From where you are you have to cross the bridge to get to us.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She swallowed, tried to breathe. She watched a hand that didn&#x2019;t seem like hers grasp at the edge of the counter. She watched the fingers try and fail to grip the edge. There was a sharp sound all around her, a high-pitched noise three octaves beyond glass breaking.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mrs. Hawthorne?<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mmmmmmph.&nbsp;</i>The only sound she could manage.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Later Nora would figure that it all started with her job. If she hadn&#x2019;t been a working mother. If the situation with the Watkins home hadn&#x2019;t happened, and then the horror show at the Millers&#x2019; house. If she&#x2019;d been more available, more aware. If she&#x2019;d been better.&nbsp;<i>If if if.</i><br><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&nbsp;<br> <i>Three months earlier&nbsp;. . .</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Chapter 1<br> &nbsp;<br> ANGELA&nbsp;</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In the front of the house the rest of the family went about their business. It was early September, a shade past Labor Day. If Angela Hawthorne had to put the situation into words that her AP English teacher, Ms. Simmons, would appreciate, she might say that&nbsp;<i>the moon was picking its way across the sky.&nbsp;</i>The school year was&nbsp;<i>still&nbsp;a virgin: barely touched, unsullied.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above Angela&#x2019;s desk, tacked to the colossal bulletin board, was a calendar. Circled with a red marker snatched from Maya&#x2019;s room (seven-year-olds had a lot of markers) was the date. November first, fewer than eight weeks away. Her mother had added the rest for Angela with a black ballpoint in her neat, Catholic-girl-school hand, using exactly the words on the website:&nbsp;<i>deadline for all early-action application&nbsp;materials.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eight weeks. Seven and a half, really. So much to do. Five AP classes this year: European History. English Literature and Composition. Chemistry. Statistics. Studio Art. (&#x201c;Studio Art can be an AP class?&#x201d; her father had asked. &#x201c;That seems bogus.&#x201d; Angela, in tacit agreement, said nothing.)&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The battle for class rank was a bloody one. Its victims were laid out all across the campus of Oakville High and across much of Marin County. Figuratively, of course. Ms. Simmons might appreciate that metaphor. Sammy Marshall, felled by an ill-timed bout of mono the previous spring. (&#x201c;Not his fault,&#x201d; said Angela&#x2019;s mother. &#x201c;The poor thing.&#x201d; Was she smiling when she said that?) Porter Webb, the school&#x2019;s foremost scholar-athlete, already being scouted by the minors. Lots of time on the baseball diamond. (&#x201c;Too&nbsp;much athlete, not enough scholar,&#x201d; said Angela&#x2019;s father ruefully, though it seemed to Angela that part of the rue was manufactured.)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the moment Angela was first. Valedictorian.&nbsp;<i>But the wolves were nipping at her heels.&nbsp;</i>(Did this count as a clich�?)<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wolves were snapping at her feet.&nbsp;</i>Better? Better.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the wolves was Maria Ortiz, poetess extraordinaire, already published in several journals, only some of them obscure, fluent in four languages. (Angela&#x2019;s father: &#x201c;Technically, are we counting the Spanish as a foreign language? Because she&nbsp;<i>did&nbsp;</i>grow up speaking it at home . . .&#x201d;) Henrietta Faulkner (no relation, though if you didn&#x2019;t ask, Henrietta didn&#x2019;t offer), Angela&#x2019;s erstwhile best friend.&nbsp;<i>Erstwhile.&nbsp;</i>SAT word.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angela, are the class rankings out yet?</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask Angela. Angela&nbsp;will know the answer. Angela knows everything. Angela, did you do your homework?</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angela,&nbsp;did you practice?</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And already, in the first week of school, a paper due in AP English Lit, as though the two novels Angela read in August for summer course work weren&#x2019;t enough. It didn&#x2019;t seem fair. &#x201c;But I also have to say, for the umpty-umpth time, that life isn&#x2019;t fair. It&#x2019;s just fairer than death, that&#x2019;s all,&#x201d; said Cecily over dinner&#x2014;an aphorism she&#x2019;d picked up from&nbsp;<i>The Princess Bride,&nbsp;</i>which she&#x2019;d spent countless hours of the summer watching with her best friend, Pinkie. At ten years old, Cecily and Pinkie seemed to have an unlimited supply of leisure time with which to watch movies and ride scooters and twist each other&#x2019;s hair into unnatural shapes to see how long they held.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where was Angela&#x2019;s leisure time? Gone, vanished<i>.&nbsp;Taken from her in the night by an invisible thief.&nbsp;</i>Wait, a thief couldn&#x2019;t actually be invisible.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stolen&nbsp;in the night by an unknown assailant.&nbsp;</i>Corny. Overwritten. And assailants didn&#x2019;t necessarily steal, they might just attack.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purloined.&nbsp;</i>Better. Simple and elegant. SAT word.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, more likely, if memory served, Angela&#x2019;s free time had never truly existed. Perhaps, eons ago, when she was an infant, reclining in the Moses basket that her mother kept in the attic, the only remaining relic of Angela&#x2019;s and Cecily&#x2019;s and Maya&#x2019;s babyhoods. Maybe then Angela had had leisure time, though a foggy memory persisted of a swinging ball of red and black and white, something she was meant to study and perhaps learn from. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m saving it,&#x201d; said Angela&#x2019;s mother (about the Moses basket). &#x201c;For&nbsp;one of you. For when you have your own.&#x201d; And Angela nodded, absorbing this sentiment, while in truth she couldn&#x2019;t imagine ever marrying or becoming a mother. Where, on earth, would she find the time?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were expected to read all of&nbsp;<i>Beloved&nbsp;</i>and write a paper on its central theme. By tomorrow. Angela hadn&#x2019;t begun the book yet, never mind the paper. Cross-country practice after school, the first meet only two weeks away, six-by-one-mile repeats through the woods and over the river.<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the river and through the woods, to grandmother&#x2019;s house . . .&nbsp;</i>Angela&#x2019;s only living grandmother was her mother&#x2019;s mother; she lived in Rhode Island, nowhere accessible by horse-drawn sleigh. (Was anywhere?) Eight thirty.&nbsp;<i>The fatigue was pulling at her eyelids.&nbsp;</i>(Good?&nbsp;<i>The fatigue&nbsp;was&nbsp;like a blanket . . .&nbsp;</i>No. Too much. Pulling at the eyelids was better.) Again Angela looked at the calendar: November first. Not so long now, not so long.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should she?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She never had before, hadn&#x2019;t wanted to, hadn&#x2019;t needed to, though she kept them at the ready. They all did&#x2014;for emergencies, or not, as the case may be. Angela had gotten hers from Henrietta Faulkner, who had gotten them God-knows-where. A harmless little study aid, no big deal. A few of them secreted inside an Advil bottle, the bottle tucked inside her desk drawer, behind the pencil sharpener, the old iPod, no longer working, long since replaced, the odd collection of shoelaces.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angela pulled out the bottle and shook the capsule out into her hand. Five milligrams, not so much. Other kids used more. Lots more. Five was nothing, a baby dose. A warm-up, an appetizer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She reached for the glass of water at the edge of her desk. Hydration was super-important after a workout like the one they&#x2019;d had today. Were the varsity cross-country teams at Novato and Redwood and all across the county working as hard as they were, as hard as the mighty Warriors? It was difficult to say. They would find out when they went head to head in November, at the regional meet. Foot to foot.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She lifted the glass, drank. The capsule was so small she scarcely noticed it going down. It was a blip, a hiccup.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She waited. Nothing. She waited some more. And more. And longer. There it was. Her head cleared. It all faded to the background: the<br> <i>screech-scritch&nbsp;</i>of Cecily&#x2019;s bow across the strings (&#x201c;Practice makes perfect,&#x201d; Cecily said cheerfully, though there was little evidence that Angela could&nbsp;find to confirm the&nbsp;<i>veracity&nbsp;</i>of that statement, at least in Cecily&#x2019;s case. Although those same words had been repeated to Angela ad nauseam for the past seventeen years), the sounds of the television, the neighbor&#x2019;s dog barking at the back door to be let in or out.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There it was. Tunnel focus, that&#x2019;s what they called it. And for good reason. Angela Hawthorne, valedictorian, was staring down a tunnel, no stopping, no sleep until Cambridge.<br> <i>You get there, and then you can rest. Then you can rest.</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But not yet, not now. Now she would work until it was done, and then she would&nbsp;<i>sleep under a crimson moon.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter &nbsp;2<br> &nbsp;<br> NORA&nbsp;</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>4:44&nbsp;a.m.</i><br> <i>Dear&nbsp;Marianne:</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Do you&nbsp;know I thought about seeing a therapist?

In other words, there was no place for the intellect to act, outside of the confines of a person's own skull. Jean Amery's <i>At The Mind's Limits</i> is a focused meditation on the position of the intellectual placed in "a borderline situation, where he has to confirm the reality and effectiveness of his intellect, or to declare its impotence: in Auschwitz." In the camp, Amery writes, "The intellect very abruptly lost its basic quality: its transcendence." Considering this loss, Amery describes his own experience of torture, his reactions of resentment, anger, and bitterness, his loss of any vital sense of metaphysical questions, and his search for some way to maintain moral character and Jewish identity in the absence of such consciousness. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>Jean Amery (1912-1978) was born in Vienna and in 1938 emigrated to Belgium, where he joined the Resistance Movement. He was caught by the Germans in 1943, tortured by the SS, and survived the next two years in the concentration camps. He was author of seven volumes of essays and two novels. He committed suicide in 1978.Sidney Rosenfeld, Ph.D., Professor of German at Oberlin College, and Stella P.

Though separated by background, geography, genre, and his marriage, the two authors shared their lives in witty, wry, tender, and at times profoundly romantic letters, each drawing on the other for inspiration, comfort, and strength. They brought their literary talents to bear on a wide range of topics, discussing each others' publications, the process of translating life into fiction, the nature of the writer&#x2019;s block each encountered, books they were reading, and friends and colleagues they cherished. They also discussed the world around them, the Vietnam War, the Nixon, Carter, and Reagan presidencies, and the environmental threats facing the nation. The letters reveal the impact each had on the other&#x2019;s work, and they show the personal support Welty provided when Alzheimer&#x2019;s destroyed Macdonald&#x2019;s ability to communicate and write.<br><br>The editors of this collection, who are the definitive biographers of these two literary figures, have provided extensive commentary and an introduction. They also include Welty&#x2019;s story fragment Henry,&#x201d; which addresses Macdonald&#x2019;s disease. With its mixture of correspondence and narrative, <i>Meanwhile There Are Letters</i> provides a singular reading experience: a prose portrait of two remarkable artists and one unforgettable relationship.</p><p>Suzanne Marrs is Professor of English and Welty Foundation Scholar-in-Residence at Millsaps College. Her award-winning books about Eudora Welty include <i>One Writer&#x2019;s Imagination: The Fiction of Eudora Welty</i> (2002), <i>Eudora Welty, A Biography</i> (2005), and <i>What There Is to Say We Have Said: The Correspondence of Eudora Welty and William Maxwell</i> (2011), which she edited.

For twenty-five years he has reviewed crime fiction for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>.

The Edgar, should it win one, would presumably go to the editors, Welty biographer Suzanne Marrs and Macdonald biographer Tom Nolan, who have expertly provided the necessary bridges and identifications to shape the material into a rewarding whole. In effect, Macdonald and Welty have collaborated on a posthumous epistolary novel, one that delivers through reality the emotional power and truthfulness of great fiction." <i>Mystery Scene Magazine</i><br><br> Eudora Welty and Ross Macdonald are giants of American literature.

Surely longing is the most complex and passionate of all emotions. . . . This is as moving a love story as you will ever read.&#x201d; Lee Smith, author of <i>The Last Girls</i> and <i>Guests on Earth</i><br><br>"Eudora Welty and Ken Millar were lovers. Their passionate affection for each other was expressed in their words, written in letters, rather than in the physical. But they touched one another as deeply as if they lived and shared life together under one roof, one desk, one bed maybe more so. They exchanged thoughts about their respective art as writers but also their complete experiences as two people traveling in and out of minds and emotions as well as hotels, cities, conferences, conversations, laughs, disappointments, relationships. These letters and the two lives they reveal are a treasure. Read them, hold them as they did each other and envy them.&#x201d; Jim Lehrer, executive editor of the <i>PBS NewsHour</i> and author of <i>Top Down</i><br><br>"Across barriers of gender, background, region, and literary practice, two writers extend the gift of friendship to one another. The result is literature itself: the letter as art form and documentation of daily life as well as an expression, at once spontaneous and crafted, of that longing for understanding that can be met through a correspondence edging into an even more mysterious communication." Kevin Starr, University of Southern California<br><br> It is a truth universally acknowledged that a writer in possession of talent must be in want of another writer with talent because writers need friends, and so it is in these letters. We witness a deep abiding friendship unfurl into what can only be called a love story. Electrical currents pop beneath the surface of the prose, and then there are the breathless postscripts, for always there is more to say. The subplot is in the sign-offs and very soon, it is Love. After a fashion, they simply sign their names, Ken (Ross's real name).

Yet somehow our infatuation with our own little story&#x2014;and our determination to make it as big as we possibly can&#x2014;blinds us to the massive God Story that surrounds us on every side.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a little like me being shocked a few weeks ago by the reaction of two of New York City&#x2019;s finest as they motioned<br>me over to their squad cars in the middle of my midmorning run. The first officer&#x2019;s opening line (the exact wording of which, I&#x2019;m sad to say, cannot be repeated here) led to the inexcusable reply,<br><br>&#x201c;What does it look like I&#x2019;m doing?&#x201d;<br><br>I quickly realized I had said the wrong thing, especially to a New York cop. In a heartbeat my hands were on the hood of his car and threats of arrest were flying all over the place. I was startled and unnerved, and though it was now too late, my mouth was shut. Unless asked, I wasn&#x2019;t saying another word, especially a sarcastic one.<br><br>To make matters worse, all I could produce in the way of identification was a hotel key card&#x2014;one of those fancy&nbsp;new ones that looks cool but doesn&#x2019;t even contain the name and address of the hotel. The whole scene was going downhill<br>fast...<br><br>Things had started off innocently enough that morning as I headed out the door of our midtown-Manhattan hotel and began plodding down the sidewalk toward the East River about eight blocks away. But before I was two or three blocks<br>away it started to rain. First it was just annoying&#x2014;an intermittent spitting kind of rain. Then the wind picked up and<br>a steady, chilling downpour started making things miserable. Assessing the situation, I determined I was too far from the hotel to make turning back a sensible option, so I kept running north along the river, pressing on in the driving rain.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know what kind of shape you&#x2019;re in, but when I run I think more about survival than scenery. And when I&#x2019;m running in a cold downpour, I barely think at all. I certainly don&#x2019;t look around to read a lot of the signs. Thus, I wasn&#x2019;t paying much attention when suddenly my path was blocked by a chain-link fence. It stretched from the riverbank on my right to a concrete lane divider that had been following me on my left. Once again I considered my options. Retracing my steps still didn&#x2019;t make sense. What made sense was getting out of the rain. So without thinking I hopped over the lane divider and headed for the shelter of an overpass I now noticed across the way.<br><br>Quickly the overpass turned into an elevated roadway, so I could keep running under cover. I continued north,&nbsp;not really noticing that the lane to my right at some point became two lanes of traffic, and then three. After another mile or so, all three lanes of traffic were moving slower than I was and a driver in one of the cars shouted something in my direction. But in the rain and traffic, I couldn&#x2019;t quite make out her words and was trying to ignore her anyway. Then the overpass drifted away to the left and I was once again exposed to the rain.<br><br>Soon I noticed the lower levels of the United Nations buildings on my far left, and nearer and just ahead two police cars parked on a wide concrete median. A single officer sat in each car, their eyes meeting mine as each step I ran drew us closer. Everything seemed to be fine, until my forward progress was interrupted by the piercing &#x201c;<i>blurp&#x201d; </i>of one of the officer&#x2019;s sirens and the intense motion of his hand directing me to approach his car.<br><br>It was at that moment I realized for the first time I was running down the middle of the FDR, a six-lane expressway<br>that snakes along the eastside shoreline of Manhattan. No wonder the officer&#x2019;s first question when I finally splashed to a stop in front of his car was incredulous and unprintable.<br><br>How can you run down the middle of a New York freeway and not know it? I think the same way you can live your entire life completely oblivious to the grand story of the Creator of the universe that is unfolding all around you. The same way you can spend your days making so much of someone as small and transient as you or me, and so little of someone as glorious and eternal as God.<br><br>That&#x2019;s why this book is not about you and making your story better, but about waking up to the infinitely bigger God Story happening all around you, and God&#x2019;s invitation to you to join Him in it. It&#x2019;s about looking up to see that there&#x2019;s a story that has been going on long before you arrived on the planet and one that will go on long after you&#x2019;re gone. God is the central character of this story and of this book. He commands center stage in existence, Creation, time, life, history, redemption, and eternity.<br><br>I&#x2019;m not trying to put you down or imply that you don&#x2019;t matter. Nor am I saying that you are absent from the grand Story of God. In fact, just the opposite. Amazingly, you appear on every page, existing in God&#x2019;s thoughts long before<br>this world was made. I&#x2019;m simply stating the obvious&#x2014;that THE STORY ALREADY HAS A STAR, AND THE STAR IS NOT YOU OR ME.<br><br>And here&#x2019;s why it matters&#x2014;if we don&#x2019;t get the two stories straight, everything else in our lives will be out of sync. We&#x2019;ll spend our days trying to hijack the Story of God, turning it into the story of us. Inverting reality, we&#x2019;ll live every day as though life is all about you and me. We&#x2019;ll live as though life is our one-act play and history our story&#x2014;as though Creation is our habitation alone, existence our playground, and God our servant (that is, if we decide we need Him at all). We will throw every ounce of our energy into the fragmented and fleeting story of us. Calling the shots ourselves, me-centered thinking will dictate every move we make and how we feel.<br><br>And in the end&#x2014;when the last clap is clapped for our tiny tale&#x2014;our story will fade to black, a pitiful return on<br>our one-shot chance called &#x201c;life on earth.&#x201d; <br><br>About thirty minutes into my ordeal with the officers, the situation lightened a bit as I realized the worst that was going to happen to me was a ticket for jaywalking, something I certainly deserved. As we were waiting for my life&#x2019;s history to appear on the squad car&#x2019;s computer, the nicer of the two cops asked within earshot of the other, &#x201c;So what do you do for a living, anyway?&#x201d;<br><br>Hmmm.<br><br>Opting for the short answer, I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a pastor.&#x201d; Two sets of eyebrows rose.<br><br>&#x201c;A pastor! What kind of pastor are you?&#x201d;<br><br>I think he was looking for the name of a denomination, but I replied, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a Christian.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yeah? Well what are you doing in New York?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to speak to a group of college students tonight out in Queens.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So, what are you going to tell them?&#x201d;<br><br>For a split second time stood still. And then I told him, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to remind them that life is short and our time on earth is really brief,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why we have to make sure our lives count for the stuff that lasts forever.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what I want to do in these pages, too. Lead you to a fresh awareness of the six-lane-wide-freeway-sized God Story that you and I are running down the middle of every day.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a place that requires a constant choice. We can choose to cling to starring roles in the little-bitty stories of us, or we can exchange our fleeting moment in the spotlight for a supporting role in the eternally beautiful epic that is the Story of God.<br><br>Think of it as trading up. Abandoning the former and embracing the latter will allow our little lives to be filled with the wonder of God as we live for His fame and the unending applause of His name. And joining our small stories to His will give us what we all want most in life anyway: the assurance that our brief moments on earth count for something in a story that never ends.</p><h2>Capsized!: The Forgotten Story of the SS Eastland Disaster</h2><p><b>New York Public Library's "100 Best Books for Kids"&nbsp;<br> Kirkus Reviews' "Best Books of 2018"</b><br><br> On July 24, 1915, the SS&nbsp;<i>Eastland</i>, filled to capacity with 2,500 passengers and crew, capsized in the Chicago River while still moored to the pier. Happy picnic-goers headed for an employee outing across Lake Michigan suddenly found themselves in a struggle for their lives. Trapped belowdecks, crushed by the crowds attempting to escape the rising waters, or hurled into the river from the upper deck of the ship, roughly one-third of the passengers, mostly women and children, perished that day.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The&nbsp;<i>Eastland</i>&nbsp;disaster took more passenger lives than the&nbsp;<i>Titanic</i>&nbsp;and stands today as the greatest loss of life on the Great Lakes. <i>Capsized!&nbsp;</i>details the events leading up to the fateful day and provides a nail-biting, minute-by-minute account of the ship's capsizing. From the courage of the survivors to the despair of families who lost loved ones, author Patricia Sutton brings to light the stories of ordinary working people enduring the unthinkable.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>&nbsp;Capsized! </i>also raises critical-thinking questions for young readers: Why do we know so much about the <i>Titanic</i>'s sinking yet so little about the <i>Eastland</i> disaster?

A seemingly respectable retired Englishman, living in a flat on the Via Maggio near the Santa Trinita bridge, was shot in the back during the night. He was well-connected and Scotland Yard has dispatched two officers to &#34;assist&#34; the Italians in solving the crime. But it is the marshal, a quiet observer, not an intellectual, who manages to figure out what happened, and why.</p><p>Magdalen Nabb was born in Lancashire and trained as a potter. In 1975, she left her old life behind and moved with her son to Florence, where she knew no one and even though she didn&#39;t speak any Italian, but where she fell in love with the local setting. Her Marshal Guarnaccia series, which has been translated into ten languages, was inspired by a real local marshal she befriended in the tiny pottery town of Montelupo Fiorentino. Nabb wrote children&#39;s fiction and crime novels until her death in 2007.<b>CHAPTER 1</b><br><br> The small office was in darkness, except where the red night lamp stood by the telephone on the desk, and the white kid gloves lying on top of a sheaf of papers within the patch of light were flushed pink. A black uniform jacket was hung over the back of a swivel chair and a matching military greatcoat, lined with red, was buttoned neatly on to a hanger behind the door, alongside a well-brushed hat. There was just room in the office for a camp bed along one white-painted wall, and on the camp bed, his legs carefully placed so as not to crease the red stripe down his trousers, lay Carabiniere Bacci. He was doing night duty. The features of his Florentine face were serene. He was asleep.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was very young and he slept deeply, with a copy of the <i>Codice di Procedura Penale </i>open on his chest and a handbook of military tactics on the floor beside him. His idea had been to stay awake all night and study, but the closeness of the little office, the softness of the red light, and the silence had combined to close his brown eyes, though he thought in his dream that he was still reading.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The telephone shrilled loudly and insistently in its pool of light. Carabiniere Bacci had leapt to his feet before he was awake and saluted before he was on his feet. When he realized what the noise was, he grabbed the receiver quickly before it could wake the Marshal. A small, distressed voice said:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Marshal Guarnaccia, Marshal . . . you&#x2019;d better come round here right away, it&#x2019;s the Englishman, he&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Just a moment.&#x2019; Carabiniere Bacci felt about for the main light switch and picked up a pencil.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Marshal?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;This is not Marshal Guarnaccia, this is Carabiniere Bacci speaking, who&#x2019;s that?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a pause, then the voice continued obediently, &#x2018;Cipolla, Gianpaolo Maria.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;And the address?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;My address?&#x2019; The voice was so weak that Carabiniere Bacci wondered if he were speaking to a man or a boy.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Your address and the address you&#x2019;re speaking from if they&#x2019;re different.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Via Romana eighty-three red, that&#x2019;s my address.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;And you&#x2019;re speaking from?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Via Maggio fifty-eight.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;And there&#x2019;s been a crime committed there?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Yes, it&#x2019;s the Englishman . . . Is the Marshal not there? My sister lives next door to the Marshal, with her husband being a gardener in the Boboli, so I know him&#x2014;and the Marshal . . .&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Might I ask you,&#x2019; said Carabiniere Bacci with all the cold dignity of his two months&#x2019; practical experience, &#x2018;just what you&#x2019;re doing in Via Maggio in the middle of the night if you live down Via Romana?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another pause. Then the small voice said, &#x2018;But . . . it&#x2019;s morning . . . I work here.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I see. Well. Stay where you are and I&#x2019;ll be over there in five minutes.&#x2019; Carabiniere Bacci pulled on his jacket and greatcoat and adjusted his hat and kid gloves carefully. It distressed him not to wash and shave but the matter might be urgent . . . he hesitated, looking toward the door that led to the Marshal&#x2019;s living quarters and then back at the door where his coat had hung and where a Beretta nine was now visible, hung up with its white leather holster and webbing. The Marshal was sweating in bed with the onset of flu, which was why Carabiniere Bacci had insisted on sleeping in the office instead of going upstairs to bed&#x2014;quite unnecessarily, in the Marshal&#x2019;s opinion&#x2014;but Carabiniere Bacci was known as the &#x2018;perfect student.&#x2019; Quietly he took down the gun, checked it and strapped it on with an eye on the inner door. He ought to wake the Marshal, perhaps, or phone through to Borgo Ognissanti in case he needed help . . . but if he phoned Headquarters they would surely tell him to stay where he was and they&#x2019;d send an Officer . . . Carabiniere Bacci had never in his life been near the scene of a crime . . . still . . . he was drumming softly with his gloved fingers on the desk. The Marshal had said that if anything important came up&#x2014;it might not be anything at all, of course&#x2014;nothing ever did happen at Stazione Pitti . . .<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carabiniere Bacci did not like the Marshal. In the first place because he was Sicilian and he suspected him of being, if not actually Mafia, at least <i>mafioso</i>, and he knew that the Marshal knew of his suspicion and even encouraged it. He seemed to think it was funny. He disliked the Marshal in the second place because he was too large and fat and had an embarrassing eye complaint&#x2014;embarrassing to Carabiniere Bacci&#x2014;that caused him to weep copiously during the hours of sunlight. And since he continually mourned the absence of his wife and children who were at home in Syracuse, his rolling tears often seemed distressingly real&#x2014;distressing to Carabiniere Bacci. The Marshal himself would fish unperturbedly for the dark glasses that were always in one of his voluminous pockets and explain to anyone and everyone, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s all right, just a complaint I have. It&#x2019;s the sunshine starts it off.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought he wouldn&#x2019;t wake the Marshal. Via Maggio was only two steps away. He could be there and back in ten minutes and then wake him if it seemed necessary. He stepped outside and locked the office door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The caller had been right&#x2014;it was morning, just about. A sluggish, damp December dawn. Thick yellow fog rose off the river and seeped along the narrow streets to deaden Carabiniere Bacci&#x2019;s footsteps as he came out under the dark, stone archway and crossed the sloping forecourt of the Pitti palace. The few ghostly cars that had been left there all night were misted with fine droplets of moisture. He crossed the silent piazza and cut through an alley that slit the high buildings dividing Piazza Pitti from Via Maggio. He was shivering inside his heavy greatcoat, aware of the whole city sleeping behind closed shutters. The streetlights were still on, but since the narrow passage had only one iron lamp at each end, Carabiniere Bacci had to tread carefully, squeezing past the inevitable line of illegally parked mopeds, his nose discreetly lifted against the stench of drains that hung in the dawn fog and that would not be dispersed until the rush-hour traffic drove it off and replaced it with exhaust fumes. Halfway along the alley, at its gloomiest point, he stumbled on to a Coca-Cola can that rolled away along the uneven flags, rattling his nerves. When he came out in Via Maggio he&nbsp; stopped, wondering which way to go. To his right, the street of tall Renaissance palaces went along to the river and the Santa Trinita bridge, invisible now in the fog; to his left, a shorter stretch of the street led to a tiny triangular piazza where it met the road coming from the Pitti. Consulting both the red and black numbering systems carefully, Carabiniere Bacci turned left toward the little piazza and crossed over . . . 52 . . . 106 red . . . 108 red . . . the faint old red numbers were barely visible in the gray half-light but the large black ones stood out clearly on their white plates and it was a black one he was looking for . . . 54 . . . 110 red . . . 56 . . . 58. There was an indecipherable coat of arms carved in stone at first-floor level. The gigantic, iron-studded doors reached up to the coat of arms, and the shutters on all three upper floors were closed. No thread of light was showing to indicate which floor the call had come from and Carabiniere Bacci realized now that he had forgotten to ask what name to look for. There was a bank housed in the ground floor of the building and a shop with its metal shutter down. The shop marked the end of Via Maggio and faced the little piazza. It was the shop which eventually reminded him&#x2014;an Englishman&#x2014;he&#x2019;d read it somewhere . . . &#x2018;A nation of shopkeepers&#x2019; . . . he ran a whitegloved finger delicately down the polished brass bellplate, peering closely at the list of names . . . Frediani . . . Cipriani . . . Cesarini . . . no . . . A. Langley-Smythe, that would be it on the ground-floor right&#x2014;but surely not the ground floor? The nameplate on the bell opposite was blank, must be a porter&#x2019;s lodge. Up on the top floor left was another English name: &#x2018;Miss E. White,&#x2019; with, in brackets, &#x2018;Landor.&#x2019; But the caller had certainly said a man. He rang the ground-floor bell. No answer. He rang again, bending to put his ear to the speaker. Nothing. It could be a hoax . . . or even a trap of some sort, it often happened . . . he&#x2019;d heard stories . . . he was getting a little nervous. It could be some Sicilian who had it in for the Marshal . . . <i>or terrorists! </i>&#x2018;Nothing ever happens at Stazione Pitti,&#x2019; he repeated to himself quietly, and then he heard footsteps. They seemed near but they couldn&#x2019;t be coming from inside the building, nothing could be heard beyond those doors. The footsteps were coming round the corner beyond the shop, slow, heavy steps. A dark figure emerged from the fog; it was the private night guard on his round.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Open up for me,&#x2019; demanded Carabiniere Bacci when the guard reached him. &#x2018;There&#x2019;s something wrong in here.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Nothing wrong when I last passed,&#x2019; said the guard phlegmatically, pushing back his cap. He selected a key from the rattling bunch in his hand, unlocked one of the great doors and leaned on it with his shoulder enough to open it a couple of feet. He tossed in the white ticket that proved to the residents that he had done his round, then stood back. His radio coughed suddenly into life and just as suddenly silenced itself with a whistle.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;And is that all you did on your last round?&#x2019; asked Carabiniere Bacci severely.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;No. I went up in the lift and checked every door. You&#x2019;ll find a ticket in every one if you&#x2019;re going in there. But since you&#x2019;re here I&#x2019;ll leave you to it this time.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;You could come in on your next round . . . I might want you to take a message . . .&#x2019; Carabiniere Bacci wished again that he&#x2019;d had time to shave. He felt less confident than when he&#x2019;d first stepped out of the office.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I&#x2019;m off home,&#x2019; said the guard. &#x2018;My last round. Bank guard should be here at eight.&#x2019; He walked on with deliberate steps, selected another key and vanished into the next big doorway. Well, the bank guard, when he came, was sure to be an ex-carabiniere and more helpful. Carabiniere Bacci pushed at the studded oak with his shoulder until the door opened enough to admit him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A wide, stone-flagged passage, ill-lit by a tiny night-light, led to a pair of high, wooden carriage gates which would presumably open on to the central courtyard of the building. Carabiniere Bacci felt for a switch and turned on a marginally stronger bulb hanging in a spiked iron lantern before the gates. To his right was the staff entrance to the bank, to his left a disused porter&#x2019;s lodge with the inquiry window boarded up. Walking slowly and loudly on the flagged floor, he reached the locked gates and followed a smaller passage round to the left where a wide stone staircase led to the upper floors. At the bottom of the staircase, on the left, were the tenants&#x2019; letter-boxes, on the right, a lift and a door which looked as if it might lead to a storeroom. A crack of yellow light was showing round this door. The name on the bell was A. Langley-Smythe. Carabiniere Bacci&#x2019;s loud footfall stopped. With one gloved finger he pushed gently on the door until it swung open. A parchment lamp was lit on a dusty, littered desk. Beyond it the room was gloomy and he didn&#x2019;t see A. Langley-Smythe at first. He did see, sitting by the lamp in an upright chair as if he were on guard, a tiny, ashen-faced man with a brush of spiky hair and a black cotton overall.</p><h2>How to Ruin a Queen: Marie Antoinette and the Diamond Necklace Affair</h2><p>In 1785, a sensational trial began in Paris that would divide the country and captivate Europe. A leading Catholic cardinal and scion of one of the most distinguished families in France stood accused of forging the queen's signature to obtain the most expensive piece of jewelry in Europe: a 2,800-carat diamond necklace. Where were the diamonds? Was the cardinal innocent? Was, for that matter, the queen? The revelations from the trial would bedevil the French monarchy as the country descended into a bloody revolution.<br><br>In <i>How to Ruin a Queen</i>, award-winning author Jonathan Beckman tells of political machinations and enormous extravagance; of kidnappings, prison breaks, and assassination attempts; of hapless French police in disguise, reams of lesbian pornography, and a duel fought with poisoned pigs.

To commemorate the 40th anniversary of their beginning, with Master and Commander, these evocative stories are being re-issued in paperback with smart new livery. This is the fourteenth book in the series. Patrick O&#39;Brian is regarded by many as the greatest living historical novelist writing in English. In The Nutmeg of Consolation, Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin begin stranded on an uninhabited island in the Dutch East Indies, attacked by ferocious Malay pirates. They contrive their escape, but after a stay in Batavia and a change of ship, they are caught up in a night chase in the fiercely tidal waters and then embroiled in the much more insidious conflicts of the terrifying penal settlements of New South Wales. It is one of O&#39;Brian&#39;s most accomplished and gripping books.</p><p>Shipwrecked! When Captain Aubrey and his crew go aground on a remote island, they labor to construct a seaworthy schooner from the wreckage (taking breaks, of course, to play cricket.)

But the title also points to the enigma of beauty created out of that experience of cultural lynching, in poems of urgency, elegance, wisdom and brave humour.&nbsp;<i>Strange Fruit</i> charts a movement from the pain of poems &#x201c;written along the v/edge &amp; coast of death and carrefour&#x201d;, the despair of sensed erasure and abandonment, of dwindled voice, to a moment of revelation of a living ancestral presence. On the way, what you hear is Brathwaite&#x2019;s distinctive Barbadian nation-voice, his alter-native vision, his creolisms of sound and graphic display, in dialogue with presences of many kinds: icons of survival and resistance such as Louis Armstrong, &#x201c;teef of sorrow&#x201d;, Bedward, Mandela, Ogou with his prompting to resolve and the visiting sparrows who are &#x201c;messengers of soul&#x201d;.&nbsp;The urgency comes in the dialogue between a sense of frailty (&#x201c;the last green slanting curve/ of wind and final bell&#x201d;) and the urge to recreate the world against the loss of memory, the recognition that &#x201c;o yes we leave &#x2013; and soon//but what happens to the turn/of spirits left on their wheel &amp; verge/of final shape. the soft concentric runnels of our labour?&#x201d; The wisdom comes out of the struggle between acknowledging the pain of loss, the fear that the world is becoming a worse, not better place, and the satisfactions to be found in knowing one has resisted.&nbsp;It is a collection full of beauties of form, phrase and sound, such as in the poem &#x201c;Sleep Widow&#x201d; where instead of finding comfort, the poet and loved woman &#x201c;bull-fight like lock-horm logga-head until the evening pools the grief along our edges/ and cools us to this peace&#x201d;, the very sounds in the poem fighting their way towards resolution.&nbsp;This text is performed in the author's SVS-sycorax video style.</p><p><b>Kamau Brathwaite&nbsp;</b>was born in Bridgetown, Barbados, in 1930.

A thousand years of European history are spanned in relatively few pages of briefly captioned, brightly colored photographs and reproductions. Any of these pages will make readers want to know more. (It will also make them wonder, ``How do we know that?'' without giving them a bibliography or other sources of further information.) Readers won't always know exactly what they're looking at: In a typical spread, entitled ``Holy Orders,'' there are photographs of objects from the 7th through the 13th centuries. The countries of origin are not always given; while some pieces are from the period, others look like modern reproductions. Many photos are just too small, e.g., the elaborate tapestry of the Hanseatic League is reduced almost to the size of a postage stamp. There are no maps, and the text is so abbreviated as to sound superficial: ``Peasants spent most of the daylight hours outside, so the drafts and little light from their unglazed windows did not trouble them.''

This edition restores many of the controversial passages expurgated in the 1922 edition.</p><p>Before Joseph Campbell became the world's most famous practitioner of comparative mythology, there was Sir James George Frazer. <i>The Golden Bough</i> was originally published in two volumes in 1890, but Frazer became so enamored of his topic that over the next few decades he expanded the work sixfold, then in 1922 cut it all down to a single thick edition suitable for mass distribution. The thesis on the origins of magic and religion that it elaborates "will be long and laborious," Frazer warns readers, "but may possess something of the charm of a voyage of discovery, in which we shall visit many strange lands, with strange foreign peoples, and still stranger customs." Chief among those customs--at least as the book is remembered in the popular imagination--is the sacrificial killing of god-kings to ensure bountiful harvests, which Frazer traces through several cultures, including in his elaborations the myths of Adonis, Osiris, and Balder.<p> While highly influential in its day, <i>The Golden Bough</i> has come under harsh critical scrutiny in subsequent decades, with many of its descriptions of regional folklore and legends deemed less than reliable. Furthermore, much of its tone is rooted in a philosophy of social Darwinism--sheer cultural imperialism, really--that finds its most explicit form in Frazer's rhetorical question: "If in the most backward state of human society now known to us we find magic thus conspicuously present and religion conspicuously absent, may we not reasonably conjecture that the civilised races of the world have also at some period of their history passed through a similar intellectual phase?" (The truly civilized races, he goes on to say later, though not particularly loudly, are the ones whose minds evolve beyond religious belief to embrace the rational structures of scientific thought.) Frazer was much too genteel to state plainly that "primitive" races believe in magic because they are too stupid and backwards to know any better; instead he remarks that "a savage hardly conceives the distinction commonly drawn by more advanced peoples between the natural and the supernatural." And he certainly was not about to make explicit the logical extension of his theories--"that Christian legend, dogma, and ritual" (to quote Robert Graves's summation of Frazer in <i>The White Goddess</i>) "are the refinement of a great body of primitive and barbarous beliefs." Whatever modern readers have come to think of the book, however, its historical significance and the eloquence with which Frazer attempts to develop what one might call a unifying theory of anthropology cannot be denied. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>This greatly revised and enlarged twelve-volume third edition (1911-15) of the controversial work by Sir James Frazer (1854-1941) applies the techniques of comparative ethnography to classical religion. Volumes 10 and 11 (1913) continue to examine taboo behaviour, and consider the role of sunlight and firelight in ritual.</p><h2>Shark Wars #3: Into the Abyss</h2><p>Gray, Barkley, and the alliance of Rogue, Coral, and AuzyAuzy Shivers have defeated the maniacal emperor Finnivus and his vicious Indi Shiver armada.

This storytelling artist&#39;s skills makes his artwork a centerpiece of interest wherever people gather.Joey wants a glimpse of the Sandman. In bed, waiting for his chance, Joey feels his lids grow heavy; then, suddenly, he is soaring through the heavens in his Redd Rocket wagon. The wagon topples, Joey falls (very much shades of In the Night Kitchen), coming to rest in the nets suspended below a sky schooner, piloted by the Sandman. The old dream weaver--he looks like he could be Jerry Garcia's brother--hauls Joey aboard and gives him a guided tour. When Joey awakens later, he finds his Redd Rocket wagon all decked out in its heavenly regalia. A diverting enough story, told in a wide-eyed style that keeps things moving and interesting. The illustrations are reproduced from limited- edition art prints. But for all the pictures' obvious quality, there's just too much hoopla about this book and its art: lush, sure-handed oils the likes of which are now sported by many a picture book--many of which have a good deal more personality. Each print is boldly signed by Morrissey, which robs them of at least some of their magic, not to mention that it gets a tad grating. A handsome book that, despite its efforts to be wondrous, is just pleasantly decorative. (Fiction/Picture book.

In 2015 The Girl in the Spider&#39;s Web, his continuation of Stieg Larsson&#39;s Millennium Trilogy, became a worldwide bestseller, and it was announced that Lagercrantz would write two further novels in the series. He is also the author of the acclaimed and bestselling I am Zlatan Ibrahimovic, and Fall of Man in Wilmslow.Wrange tried to concentrate on the game, but he was not managing too well. Fortunately this punk girl was going to be easy pickings. She wasn&#x2019;t bad, as it turned out&#x2014;she probably spent a lot of time playing&#x2014;but what good was that? He toyed with her a little, and she was bound to be impressed. Who knows, maybe he could even get her to come home with him after- wards. True, she looked stroppy, and Wrange did not go in for stroppy girls, but she had nice tits and he might be able to take out his frustrations on her. It had been a disaster of a morning. <br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t grief that he felt: it was fear. Wrange really did try hard to convince himself that he had done the right thing. What did the goddamn professor expect when he treated him as if he didn&#x2019;t exist? But of course it wouldn&#x2019;t look good that Wrange had sold him down the river. He consoled himself with the thought that an idiot like Balder must have made thou- sands of enemies, but deep down he knew: the one event was linked to the other, and that scared him to death.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ever since Balder had started working at Solifon, Wrange had been afraid that the drama would take a frightening new turn, and here he was now, wishing that it would all go away. That must have been why he went into town this morning on a compulsive spree to buy a load of designer clothes, and had ended up here at the chess club. Chess still managed to distract him, and the fact was that he was feeling better already. He felt like he was in control and smart enough to keep on fooling them all. Look at how he was playing.<br> &nbsp;<br> This girl was not half bad. In fact there was something unorthodox and creative in her play, and she would probably be able to teach most people in here a thing or two. It was just that he, Arvid Wrange, was crushing her. His play was so brilliant and sophisticated that she had not even noticed he was on the brink of trapping her queen. Stealthily he moved his positions forward and&nbsp; snapped it up&nbsp; without sacrificing more than a knight. In a flirty, casual tone bound to impress her he said, &#x201c;Sorry, baby. Your queen is down.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> But he got nothing in return, no smile, not a word, nothing. The girl upped the tempo, as if she wanted to put a quick end to her humiliation, and why not? He&#x2019;d be happy to keep the process short and take her out for two or three drinks before he pulled her. Maybe he would not be very nice to her in bed. The chances were that she would still thank him afterwards. A miserable cunt like her would be unlikely to have had a fuck for a long time and would be totally unused to guys like him, cool guys who played at this level. He decided to show off a bit and explain some higher chess theory. But he never got the chance. Something on the board did not feel quite right. His game began to run into some sort of resistance he could not understand. For a while he persuaded himself that it was only his imagination, perhaps the result of a few careless moves. If only he concentrated he would be able to put things right, and so he mobilized his killer instinct.<br> &nbsp;<br> But the situation just got worse.<br> &nbsp;<br> He felt trapped&#x2014;however hard he tried to regain the initiative she hit back&#x2014;and in the end he had no choice but to acknowledge that the balance of power had shifted, and shifted irreversibly. How crazy was that? He had taken her queen, but instead of building on that advantage he had landed in a fatally weak position. Surely she had not deliberately sacrificed her queen so early in the game? That would be impossible&#x2014;the sort of thing you read about in books, it doesn&#x2019;t happen in your local chess club in Vasastan, and it&#x2019;s definitely not something that pierced punk chicks with attitude problems do, especially not to great players like him. Yet there was no escape.<br> &nbsp;<br> In four or five moves he would be beaten and so he saw no alternative but to knock over his king with his index finger and mumble congratulations. Even though he would have liked to serve up some excuses, some- thing told him that that would make matters worse. He had a sneaking feeling that his defeat was not just down to bad luck, and almost against his will he began to feel frightened again. Who the hell was she?<br> Cautiously he looked her in the eye and now she no longer looked like a stroppy, insecure nobody. Now she seemed cold&#x2014;like a predator eyeing its prey.

Dallben himself had so ordered it; and though Taran's heart was suddenly and strangely heavy, he knew there was no gainsaying the old enchanter's words.On the spring morning set for Eilonwy's departure, Taran saddled the horses and led them from the stable. The Princess, looking desperately cheerful, had wrapped her few belongings in a small bundle slung from her shoulder. At her neck hung a fine chain and crescent moon of silver; on her finger she wore a ring of ancient craftsmanship; and in the fold of her cloak she carried another of her most prized possessions: the golden sphere that shone at her command with a light brighter than a flaming torch.Dallben, whose face was more careworn than usual and whose back was bowed as though under a heavy burden, embraced the girl at the cottage door. "You shall always have a place in Caer Dallben," he said, "and a larger one in my heart. But, alas, raising a young lady is a mystery beyond even an enchanter's skill. I have had," he added with a quick smile, "difficulties enough raising an Assistant Pig-Keeper."I wish you a fair voyage to the Isle of Mona," Dallben went on. "King Rhuddlum and Queen Teleria are kindly and gracious. They are eager to stand in your family's stead and serve as your protectors, and from Queen Teleria you shall learn how a princess should behave.""What!" cried Eilonwy. "I don't care about being a princess! And since I'm already a young lady, how else could I behave? That's like asking a fish to learn how to swim!""Hem!" Dallben said wryly. "I have never seen a fish with skinned knees, torn robe, and unshod feet. They would ill become him, as they ill become you." He set a gnarled hand gently on Eilonwy's shoulder. "Child, child, do you not see? For each of us comes a time when we must be more than what we are." He turned now to Taran. "Watch over her carefully," he said. "I have certain misgivings about letting you and Gurgi go with her, but if it will ease your parting, so be it.""The Princess Eilonwy shall go safely to Mona," Taran answered."And you," said Dallben, "return safely. My heart will not be at ease until you do." He embraced the girl again and went quickly into the cottage.It had been decided that Coll would accompany them to Great Avren harbor and lead back the horses. The stout old warrior, already mounted, waited patiently. Shaggy-haired Gurgi, astride his pony, looked as mournful as an owl with a stomachache. Kaw, the tame crow, perched in unwonted silence on Taran's saddle. Taran helped Eilonwy mount Lluagor, her favorite steed, then swung to the back of Melynlas, his silver-maned stallion.Leaving Caer Dallben behind, the little band set out across the soft hills toward Avren. Side by side Taran and Coll rode ahead ofthe others to lead the way, Kaw meanwhile having made himself comfortable on Taran's shoulder."She never stopped talking for a moment," Taran said gloomily. "Now, at least, it will be quieter in Caer Dallben.""That it will," said Coll."And less to worry about. She was always getting into one scrape or another.""That, too," said Coll."It's for the best," Taran said. "Eilonwy is, after all, a Princess of Llyr. It's not as if she were only an Assistant Pig-Keeper.""Very true," said Coll, looking off toward the pale hills.They jogged along silently for a while."I shall miss her," Taran burst out at last, half angrily.The old warrior grinned and rubbed his shining bald head. "Did you tell her that?""Not--not exactly," faltered Taran. "I suppose I should have. But every time I began talking about it I--I felt very odd. Besides, you never know what silly remark she'll come out with when you're trying to be serious.""It may be," replied Coll, smiling, "we know least what we treasure most. But we will have more than enough to keep us busy when you come back, and you will learn, my boy, there is nothing like work to put the heart at rest."Taran nodded sadly. "I suppose so," he said.&nbsp;<br>Past midday they turned their horses to the west, where the hills began a long slope downward into the Avren valley. At the last ridge Kaw hopped from Taran's shoulder and flapped aloft, croaking with excitement. Taran urged Melynlas over the rise. Below, thegreat river swung into view, wider here than he had ever seen it. Sunlight flecked the water in the sheltered curve of the harbor. A long, slender craft bobbed at the shore. Taran could make out figures aboard, hauling on ropes to raise a square, white sail.Eilonwy and Gurgi had also ridden forward. Taran's heart leaped; and to all the companions the sight of the harbor and the waiting vessel was like a sea wind driving sorrow before it. Eilonwy began chattering gaily, and Gurgi waved his arms so wildly he nearly tumbled from the saddle."Yes, oh yes!" he cried. "Bold, valiant Gurgi is glad to follow kindly master and noble Princess with boatings and floatings!"They cantered down the slope and dismounted at the water's edge. Seeing them, the sailors ran a plank out from the vessel to the shore. No sooner had they done so than a young man clambered onto the plank and hastened with eager strides toward the companions. But he had taken only a few paces along the swaying board when he lost his footing, stumbled, and with a loud splash pitched headlong into the shallows.Taran and Coll ran to help him, but the young man had already picked himself up and was awkwardly sloshing his way ashore. He was of Taran's age, with a moon-round face, pale blue eyes, and straw-colored hair. He wore a sword and a small, richly ornamented dagger in a belt of silver links. His cloak and jacket, worked with threads of gold and silver, were now sopping wet; the stranger, however, appeared not the least dismayed either by his ducking or the sodden state of his garments. Instead, he grinned as cheerfully as if nothing whatever had befallen him."Hullo, hullo!" he called, waving a dripping hand. "Is that Princess Eilonwy I see? Of course! It must be!"Without further ado, and without stopping even to wring out his cloak, he bowed so low that Taran feared the young man would lose his balance; then he straightened up and in a solemn voice declared: "On behalf of Rhuddlum Son of Rhudd and Teleria Daughter of Tannwen, King and Queen of the Isle of Mona, greetings to the Princess Eilonwy of the Royal House of Llyr, and to--well--to all the rest of you," he added, blinking rapidly as a thought suddenly occurred to him. "I should have asked your names before I started."Taran, taken aback and not a little vexed by this scatterbrained behavior, stepped forward and presented the companions. Before he could ask the stranger's name, the young man interrupted."Splendid! You must all introduce yourselves again later, one at a time. Otherwise, I might forget--oh, I see the shipmaster's waving at us. Something to do with tides, no doubt. He's always very concerned with them. This is the first time I've commanded a voyage," he went on proudly. "Amazing how easy it is. All you need to do is tell the sailors ...""But who are you?" Taran asked, puzzled.The young man blinked at him. "Did I forget to mention that? I'm Prince Rhun."<i>"Prince</i> Rhun?" Taran repeated in a tone of disbelief."Quite so," answered Rhun, smiling pleasantly. "King Rhuddlum's my father; and, of course, Queen Teleria's my mother. Shall we go aboard? I should hate to upset the shipmaster, for he does worry about those tides."Coll embraced Eilonwy. "When we see you again," he told her, "I doubt we shall recognize you. You shall be a fine Princess.""I want to be recognized!" Eilonwy cried. "I want to be me!""Never fear," said Coll, winking. He turned to Taran. "And you, my boy, farewell. When you return, send Kaw ahead to tell me and I shall meet you at Avren harbor."Prince Rhun, offering his arm to Eilonwy, led her across the plank. Gurgi and Taran followed them. Having formed his own opinion of Rhun's agility, Taran kept a wary eye on the Prince until Eilonwy was safe aboard.The ship was surprisingly roomy and well-fitted. The deck was long, with benches for oarsmen on either side. At the stern rose a high, square shed topped by a platform.The sailors dipped their oars and worked the vessel to the middle of the river. Coll trotted along the bank and waved with all his might. The old warrior dropped from sight as the ship swung around a bend in the ever-widening river. Kaw had flapped to the masthead and, as the breeze whistled through his feathers, he beat his wings so pridefully that he looked more like a black rooster than a crow. The shore turned gray in the distance and the craft sped seaward.If Rhun had perplexed and vaguely irritated him at their first meeting, Taran now began to wish he had never laid eyes on the Prince. Taran had meant to speak with Eilonwy apart, for there was much in his heart he longed to tell her. Yet each time he ventured to do so, Prince Rhun would pop up as if from nowhere, his round face beaming happily, calling out, "Hullo, hullo!"--a greeting Taran found more infuriating each time he heard it.Once, the Prince of Mona eagerly dashed up to show the companions a large fish he had caught--to the delight of Eilonwy and Gurgi, but not Taran; for a moment later, Rhun's attention turnedelsewhere and he hurried off, leaving Taran holding the wet, slippery fish in his arms. Another time, while leaning over the side to point out a school of dolphins, the Prince nearly dropped his sword into the sea. Luckily Taran caught it before the blade was lost foreve...</p><h2>The Transplanted: A History of Immigrants in Urban America (Interdisciplinary Studies in History)</h2><p><p>"... an excellent broad overview...

E. Hotchner decided that rather than just distribute Paul&#x2019;s own salad dressing at Christmas to neighbors, they would offer it to a few local stores. Freewheeling, irreverent entrepreneurs, they conceived of their venture as a great way to poke fun at the mundane method of traditional marketing. Much to their surprise, the dressing was enthusiastically received. What had started as a lark quickly escalated into a full-fledged business, the first company to place all-natural foods in supermarkets. From salad dressing to spaghetti sauce, to popcorn and lemonade, Newman&#x2019;s Own became a major player in the food business. The company&#x2019;s profits were originally donated to medical research, education, and the environment, and eventually went to the creation of the eight Hole in the Wall Gang camps for children with serious illnesses. <br><br>In these pages Newman and Hotchner recount the picaresque saga of their own nonmanagement adventure. In alternating voices, playing off one another in classic &#x201c;Odd Couple&#x201d; style, they describe how they systematically disregarded the advice of experts and relied instead on instinct, imagination, and mostly luck. They write about how they hurdled obstacle after obstacle, share their hilarious misadventures, and reveal their offbeat solutions to conventional problems. Even their approach to charity is decidedly different: every year they give away all the company&#x2019;s profits, empty the coffers, and start over again. The results of this amazing generosity are brought to life in heartwarming stories about the children at their camps.<br><br>With rare glimpses into their zany style and their compassion for those less fortunate, Newman and Hotchner have written the perfect nonmanagement book, at once playful, informative, and inspirational.</p><p><p><b>PAUL NEWMAN</b> (known as ol&#x2019; PL to both friends and enemies.)<br>The <i>L</i> stands for &#x201c;Leonard&#x201d; or &#x201c;Lunkhead.&#x201d; He answers to both. He is probably best known for his spectacularly successful food conglomerate. In addition to giving the profits to charity, he also ran Frank Sinatra out of the spaghetti sauce business. On the downside, the spaghetti sauce is out-grossing his films. He did graduate from Kenyon College magna cum lager and in the process begat a laundry business which was the only student-run enterprise on Main Street. Yale University later awarded him an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters for unknown reasons. He has won four Sports Car Club of America National Championships and is listed in the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> as the oldest driver (70) to win a professionally sanctioned race (24 Hours of Daytona, 1995). He is married to the best actress on the planet, was number 19 on Nixon&#x2019;s enemy list, and purely by accident has 51 films and four Broadway plays. He is generally considered by professionals to be the worst fisherman on the East Coast.<br><br><b>A. E. HOTCHNER</b><br>fully intended to be a career lawyer but after two stultifying years practicing with a St. Louis law firm, he escaped into the wild blue yonder of the Air Force, vowing never to look at another Corpus Juris Secundum. After the war, Hotch became a literary bounty hunter, and in the process met Ernest Hemingway, with whom he buddied around for fourteen years, an adventurous period that Hotch chronicled in <i>Papa Hemingway</i>, which was published in 34 countries in 28 different languages. In between selling salad dressing, Hotch has written fifteen books, a dozen plays and musicals, and scores of television dramas. In 1999, Washington University conferred on him an honorary Doctor of Letters to go along with his doctor of law degree, but he is proudest of the fact that he was crowned marbles champion of St. Louis when he was in the sixth grade.</p>Chapter 1<br>It is December 1980, a week before Christmas, Westport, Connecticut, a blanket of snow on the ground, wood smoke from fireplaces redolent in the air, tree lights festooning the houses, a pervasive Yuletide lilt, but we are laboring in the subterranean space beneath Paul's converted barn, an area that had once been a stable for farm horses. There is a bucket filled with ice-blanketed Budweisers and an array of bottles of olive oil, vinegar, mustard, condiments, and so forth. There is also an empty tub and a collection of old bottles dating back to Revolutionary times by their appearance, bottles of various shapes and sizes that had been somewhat sanitized for this occasion.<br><br>Paul Newman, known to his friends as ol' PL or Calezzo de Wesso (Bonehead), had asked his buddy A. E. Hotchner (Hotch), sometimes called Sawtooth, to help him with a Christmas project that he was assembling in this basement, which wasn't a basement in the usual sense. There were crusty stones, a dirt floor, crumbling cement, and overhead timbers covered with active cobwebs. Also three long since vacated horse stalls, but the unmistakable aroma of horses remained. There were desiccated manure fragments here and there, and there was evidence that certain field animals were still occupying the premises. A very picturesque place in which to mix salad dressing.<br><br>The project was to mix up a batch of PL's salad dressing in the washtub and fill all those old wine bottles using the assembled funnels and corks and labels, and on Christmas Eve our collective families would go around the neighborhood singing carols and distributing these gift bottles of PL's dressing.<br><br>PL was very proud of his salad dressing, and this was the apotheosis of his salad days. Over the years, even in four-star restaurants, PL had been rejecting the house dressings and concocting his own. Captains, ma"tre D's, and sometimes the restaurant owner would scurry around to assemble Paul's ingredients while neighboring diners gawked in disbelief. When we first ate at Elaine's, one of New York's popular restaurants, several waiters and Elaine herself gathered round as Paul blended and tasted the brew he made from the ingredients brought to him from the kitchen. This scene had been repeated in such varied eateries as a Greek diner, at a wedding party, in an outdoor restaurant, on the island of Eleuthera, and in snazzy restaurants from coast to coast. When his kids went off to school, Paul would fill a couple of bottles of dressing for them to take along. On one occasion, when the restaurant mistakenly served the salad with its own dressing, Paul took the salad to the men's room, washed off the dressing, dried it with paper towels, and, after returning to the table, anointed it with his own, which he concocted with ingredients brought to him from the kitchen.<br><br>At that time, almost all dressings, especially the mass-market ones, contained sugar, artificial coloring, chemical preservatives, gums, and God knows what. So Paul really started to make his own dressing not just as a taste preference, but also as a defense against those insufferable artificial additives.<br><br>That evening the basement operation seemed to go on forever. We had never tried to mix a vat of salad dressing, let alone pound a 1925 syrup cork into an 1895 vinegar bottle, especially after a few beers. Sometimes the mallet would smack the cork, and sometimes it nailed our thumbs. Paul carefully measured amounts of olive oil and vinegar, for he had no feel yet for dealing with a quantity like this, which, he decided, required six boxes of black pepper.<br><br>He was almost crazed as he stirred the dressing with the wooden paddle. There's a river that runs alongside his house, and the paddle most certainly came from his canoe. It was his notion that the olive oil and vinegar had a sort of hygienic effect so that one didn't have to wash anything thoroughly. That aside, he was highly critical of Hotch's paddle technique. The motion, he insisted, had to have an even, smooth rhythm that would not create frothing. But Hotch couldn't get the hang of it. "You've got to go with the paddle," Paul said. "Don't pull it straight toward you, waffle it, gyrate it, go with the paddle." Hotch said he was going with the paddle, but, having had four beers, if he went with the paddle too much, he was going to fall facedown in the tub. Paul said as long as it wasn't butt first, not to worry about it.<br><br>Occasionally, during the hours we labored, somebody would show up--Caroline, the housekeeper, or Joanne or one of Paul's kids. But they had the good sense to stop at the door. The smell of vintage horse piss and mold had now commingled with the aroma of Budweiser and the salad dressing ingredients, a combination that did not exactly beckon. So they stood near the door and announced that dinner was ready, or Aunt Margaret was here, or the police wanted to invalidate Paul's driver's license, but Paul said we still had work to do, whereupon everyone seemed to scatter in a hurry. No one dared venture into that place. It was forbidding, or sanctified, maybe.<br><br>The precise number of giveaway bottles were lined up on the dirt floor like a battalion of infantry soldiers, but there was still a quantity of dressing left in the tub. That's when it occurred to Paul that we could bottle the rest, hustle them into some upscale local food stores, make a buck, and go fishing. But Hotch, a refugee from law school, put on the brakes: "It's against the law," he shouted. "Look at this place! The bugs can't even stay alive here! If somebody croaks from ingesting this stuff, you'll be in court, with no liability insurance. You could wind up without your basement and everything above it. There are certain rules and regulations to be followed--hygienic, first and foremost, proper labeling, government stuff!"<br><br>With his barn at stake, Paul agreed that they'd have to take out insurance, create a proper label, and get a bona fide bottler and see if it would sell.<br><br>And that is how our baby got started--not in a manger, but in a tub--not a wise man in sight--a fading movie star and a cantankerous writer, but that was it.<br>"You can get straight A's in marketing and still flunk ordinary life."<br>--Newman to Lee Iacocca, after Iacocca's Pinto caught fire<br>Chapter 2<br>It is 1982, and we are sitting in the conference room of the largest marketing company in America. A long, burnished table is presided over by its president, with five of his department heads in attendance, all experts in how to market new products in the United States. Very imposing. On the table in front of us we have a bottle, once filled with Chianti, now containing an olive oil and vinegar salad dressing, which is the object of this meeting.<br><br>"You gentlemen have come to the right place," the president tells us. "We launch new products for some of the biggest brands in America--Libby's, Heinz, Del Monte, Campbell's, Kraft--so we can give you an exponential trajectory on the welter of details that have to be accomplished to launch your salad dressing.<br><br>"It's essential to know in advance how the public will react to your product. So we would dispatch people across the country to gather together focus groups of varied ethnicity, financial strata, age groups, sexual preference, fast-food habits, footwear use or nonuse, deodorants, the whole load. We would go around the country, asking folks in shopping malls and such places how they like the bottle, the name, the taste--we'd have them sample it on lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cabbage, sausage. Then the price--you have to set a price for us--questions like that, and then in maybe seven or eight sections of the country we'd correlate the results and study them to let you know how to adjust all those things to maximize your introductory impact."<br><br>"What would that cost?" we ask.<br><br>"Depending on the focus depth, somewhere between three hundred and four hundred thousand dollars. Now once you're ready to roll out the product, you'll have to learn how to attend to distribution, promotion and advertising, public relations--our experience is with the big guys--Heinz, Kraft, etc., and they figure to spend a million dollars to launch a new product--that's the general rule the first year. We'll teach you how to muscle into the big stores--you'll have to make deals, especially with outfits like A&amp;P and Kroger's--discounts, two-for-ones, free stuff, just to get your bottle on the shelf--and then how to avoid winding up on the bottom shelf, down below the packed rows of Krafts and Wishbones, which have all the eye-level spaces. The odds on new products are about the same as roulette. Even the biggest companies have had expensive failures--Campbell's refrigerated soups, Gerber's 'adult' food line, Nabisco's giant-size Oreo cookies. And then there's the history of celebrity products--which Karen will tell you about."<br><br>"Celebrity products fall into a category of their own," said Karen, a trim blonde in a tailored suit. "That doesn't refer to fictional characters like Aunt Jemima, Betty Crocker, and Sara Lee. Nor does it mean endorsers, like the sport stars that appear on Wheaties boxes. But when celebrities come out with their own products--Rocky Graziano's spaghetti sauce, Mickey Mantle's barbecue sauce, Nolan Ryan's All-Star Fruit Snacks, Gloria Vanderbilt's salad dressing, Reggie Jackson's candy bar, Carl Yastrzemski's Big Yaz Bread, Diane von Furstenberg's facial tissue, Bill Blass's chocolates, Polly Bergen's Turtle Oil, Marilyn Monroe's Merlot, Fess Parker's wine, James Darren's spaghetti sauce, Phyllis Diller's Philli Dilli Chili, Richard Simmons's Salad Spray, Tommy Lasorda's spaghetti sauce, Yves St. Laurent's cigarettes, Frank Sinatra's neckties--all examples of products these famous people promoted with unsatisfactory results.

Winner of the Kafka Prize, he is a contributor to many magazines, including the New Yorker, and he is the author of numerous works, including Solaris.Ten essays, 1971-83: ranging from autobiography through analyses of the underpinnings of sf to examinations of specific authors and works - delivered in thunderous yet calculated tones, and a welter of academic polysyllables. The autobiographical piece is most engaging and revealing - with Lem candidly discussing his upbringing, his Jewish heritage, the German and Russian occupations of Poland, his own sf. Elsewhere, he demonstrates his formidable intellect and his self-imposed conceptual limitations: he finds fiction without intellectual challenge boring (and has no patience with the notion of fiction as entertainment); in his view, sf works in which neither the objects nor the ideas have any basis in reality are merely "empty games." Later, however, Lem cogently discusses sf's various time-travel motifs - notwithstanding his previous denunciation of "empty games" where "impossible time-travel machines are used to point out impossible time-travel paradoxes." "The primary unsolved problem" of sf, he writes, is "the lack of a theoretical typology of its paradigmatic structures" - yet he fails to demonstrate why this lack is so damaging. On the incestuous nature of Western sf, he's devastating: "critiques are not produced independently, but are written by either the authors or the editors of anthologies, who evaluate each other's works." (He also blasts publishers and editors for camouflaging advertising as criticism.) For all these reasons, sf is trashy and apt to remain so. Moving on to specifics, Lem shows himself to be a penetrating but often arbitrary and petulant critic. Just about the only Western sf author he approves of (Ballard and Bradbury rate a maybe) is Philip K. Dick - who "tries to probe the neglected, latent, untouched, as-yet-unrealized potentialities of human existence." A. E. van Vogt's work is condemned as "stupid lies" without a shred of evidence or analysis; Borges, Lem determines, "has suffered from a lack of a free and rich imagination." He criticizes Daniel Keyes' Flowers for Algernon for what Leto thinks Keyes' should have written; the Strugatsky brothers' Roadside Picnic - which Leto not only analyzes brilliantly, but finds enjoyable - comes in for similar treatment. Clearly, there's some ax-grinding going on. In sum: guaranteed to offend and provoke.

Part of Muir's attractiveness to modern readers is the fact that he was an activist. He not only explored the West and wrote about its beauties-- he fought for their preservation. His successes dot the landscape in all the natural features that bear his name: forests, lakes, trails, glaciers. Here collected are some of his finest wilderness essays, ranging from Alaska to Yellowstone, from Oregon to the Range of Light-- the High Sierra. <p>This series celebrates the tradition of literary naturalists-- writers who embrace the natural world as the setting for some of our most euphoric and serious experiences. Their literary terrain maps the intimate connections between the human and natural worlds, a subject defined by Mary Austin in 1920 as "a third thing... the sum of what passed between me and the Land". Literary naturalists transcend political boundaries, social concerns, and historical milieus; they speak for what Henry Beston called the "other nations" of the planet. Their message acquires more weight and urgency as wild places become increasingly scarce. This series, then, celebrates both a wonderful body of work and a fundamental truth: that nature counts as a model, a guide to how we can live in the world.</p></p><p><p>Part of John Muir's appeal to modern readers is that he not explored the American West and wrote about iys beauties but also fought for their preservation.

Margulis (Biology/U. of Mass. at Amherst) and Sagan (Biospheres, 1990) choose to do this in a particularly florid style, using the image of an androgynous stripteaser who displays facets of sexuality at different ages and stages of evolution. But that's not all. The book is (a) a kind of postfeminist review of all the sociobiological hype of the 70's and 80's. This time, however, instead of crying foul at the macho writers who wrote of breasts and buttocks and pair-bonding and said it made good genetic sense to be promiscuous, to rape, blah-blah, the authors rehash all the old theories with mild caveats that genetic predestination is not destiny. The book is also about (b) the evolution of the penis (and the possibility that size and length may confer the advantage of depositing sperm higher up in the vagina with better chances of reaching an egg than a rival's ``sperm competition''); (c) Freud, the French deconstructivists Lacan and Derrida, and phallic symbolism; (d) neoteny; (e) mating styles of the great and small; (f) the reptilian brain that presumably lives on in all of us; (g) the origin of language and time.... Finally, we learn that the usual explanation that sexual reproduction increases genetic variation, and thus the odds of adapting to changing environments, is not sufficient: cloned or fissioned creatures also differ. The answer then? Sex is an ``unkickable genetic habit''--passed on from the bacteria who knew all about passing genes back and forth, and the protists (like the amoeba) who cannibalized each other to survive. This latter theme is by far the most well developed, drawing upon Margulis's special knowledge and insights into symbiosis in cellular evolution. The rest can be described as flights of fact, fancy, and fantasy with no clear distinction. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Primeval women's swollen breasts indicated lactation, pregnancy and fertility to excited males. In the author's scenario, women lost their estrus and developed permanently enlarged breasts, "an anatomy of deception," to tame and domesticate exploitative males whose interests were narrowly focused only on mating. Female orgasm, though not necessary for reproduction, may have conferred a survival advantage on prehistoric females, the authors further argue. In like fashion, Margulis and Sagan, coauthors of Microcosmos , use evolutionary biology to illuminate orgasm inequality, phallic worship, sexy clothing, sexual jealousy and violence alleged to be rooted in our far-distant past. This eloquent, stimulating exploration of the roots of human sexuality at times succumbs to reductionism, as when the authors ascribe human dating, honeymooning and marriage to the need to maximize reproduction. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Heaven Help Heidi (Volume 2) (Family of the Heart Series)</h2><p><p>Welcome to the Casa de Vida&#x2014;eleven quaint bungalows located three blocks from the Pacific Ocean in tiny Seaside Village, California.

Tomorrow&#x2019;s Houses is a richly photographed presentation of the best modernist houses in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, built during the early twentieth century through the 1960s. From the suburbs of Connecticut to the mountains of New Hampshire and Vermont, modernism in America found some of its earliest, most idealistic, and, later, most refined realizations in houses designed by such masters as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, Mies van der Rohe, Richard Meier, Paul Rudolph, Marcel Breuer, and Walter Gropius, all of whose work is featured in these pages. Photographer Geoffrey Gross has captured in stunning full-color images these precisely composed structures and their exquisitely appointed interiors, all against the breathtaking variety of the landscapes of New England. Lauded architect and critic Alexander Gorlin places these beautiful houses in their proper historical context as examples of the best of early- and mid-twentieth-century American modernist architecture.</p><p><i>Photographer's Statement-</i><i>I was privileged to spend a day photographing at a house in Massachusetts while the family was present. A beautiful crisp autumn picture post card day; the mom-spent time in the kitchen and spent time with the daughter as well as both children. Dad did yard chores, went on errands and so forth. In the afternoon the son engaged in some hunting, bagging a few rabbits that were skinned and saved, whatever that entails. Toward the end of the day I was invited to stay for dinner- an invitation I eagerly accepted, the cooking aromas of the day ever-present.</i><i>Towards evening the mom prepared dinner while I played checkers in front of the fireplace with the children. I lost every game.</i><i>We sat down to a meal of venison stew that couldn't be beat; watched the sun set thru the extensive glass windows/walls and as that progressed I became aware that the house interior now came "alive"- what had been a thin invisible skin was now a safe, nurturing protective but transparent barrier against the night.</i><i>The house, by design, was a true "machine-for-living". A nurturing structure, it provided shelter and warmth when needed, let the sunlight shine in when present, and provided a constant cocoon-like safe, protective environment.</i>&nbsp;Alexander Gorlin established his architectural practice in 1986.

WRIGHT is an attorney turned SF and fantasy writer. He has published short fiction in <i>Asimov's SF </i>and elsewhere, and wrote the Chronicles of Chaos, The Golden Age, and The War of Dreaming series. His novel <i>Orphans of Chaos </i>was a finalist for the Nebula Award in 2005. <i>The Hermetic Millennia</i> is his second novel in the Count to a Trillion series.</p>1 <br>Theft of Fire <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>A.D. 2535 <br> <i>1. Sir Guy</i> <br>All he wanted to do was stay dead. <br>Menelaus Montrose woke up while his body was still frozen solid. The bioimplants the battle surgeons of the Knights Hospitalier had woven into his brain stem were working well enough for him to send a signal to the surface of the coffin, activate the pinpoint camera cells dotting its outer armor, and see who was trying to wake him up. <br>The light in the crypt was dim. The walls were irregular brick, and in places were cemented with bones and skulls. Niches held both coffins for the dead and cryonic suspension coffins for the slumbering. <br>There was a figure like a metal ape near the vault door, which had moved on vast pistons and stood open. The light spilled in from here. Only things near the door were clear. <br>To one side of the larger metal statue was a marble sculpture of Saint Barbara, the patron of grave-diggers, holding a cup and a palm leaf in her stiff, stone hands; to the other was Saint Ubaldo, carrying a crosier, whose office was to ward off neural disorders and obsessions. Above the vault door was a relief showing the martyrdom of Saint Renatus Goupil under the tomahawks of Iroquois. He was the patron saint of anesthesiologists and cryonicists. Above all this, in an arch, were written the words TUITIO FIDEI ET OBSEQUIUM PAUPERUM. <br>From this, Menelaus knew he had been moved, at least once, from his previous interment site beneath Tiber Island in the Fatebenefratelli Hospital vault. That had been little over a quarter century ago: the calculations of Cliomancy did not predict any historical crisis sufficient to require him to be relocated in so short a space as thirty years. That meant Blackie was interfering with the progression of history again. <br>The larger metal statue moved, ducking its head and stepping farther into the vault. Menelaus could see the Maltese cross enameled in white on the red breastplate. There were four antennae and microwave horns on his back, folded down. The scabbard for his (ceremonial) broadsword was empty, and so was the holster for his (equally ceremonial) chemical-energy pistol. Between helmet and goggles and breather mask, the figure looked like a nightmarish bug. <br>Montrose turned on the microphones on the outside of the coffin, and special cells in his brain stem sent signals to receivers dotting the inner coffin lid, and also to implants lining his auditory nerve. It sounded like a strange, flat, echoless noise, not like something that actually came through his ear, but he could make it out. <br>Menelaus turned on the speaker vox. &#x201c;Why do you disturb my slumber, Sir Knight?&#x201d; <br>He heard the ticking hum of motors and actuators coming from the armored figure. Like a mountain sinking into the sea, the big armored figure knelt. Menelaus realized this was strength-amplification armor. He tried to work out the Cliometric constellation of a set of military circumstances where this type of gear would serve any purpose that a sniper with a powerful set of winged remotes could not serve better, and his imagination failed. Unless the man was wrestling giants, or facing enemies who could walk up to arm&#x2019;s length and tear the flesh from his bones, he did not see the purpose. <br>&#x201c;My apologies, sleeper. Ah. Our records are somewhat dark. Are you Menelaus Montrose? You don&#x2019;t sound like him.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why the poxy hell do you disturb my poxy slumber, Sir goddam Knight?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ah! Montrose! Good to hear you again, Liege.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Guy? Sir Guy, is that you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Pellucid thawed me out two days ago. As we agreed, I have a veto over anyone trying to disturb you, even your pet machine. And it is His Excellency Grandmaster Guiden von Hompesch zu Bolheim now. They promoted me when I slept.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yeah, they do poxified pox like that to you when you ain&#x2019;t up and about to fend it off.&#x201d; <br>Another implanted circuit in his brain stem made contact with a library cloth stored in an airtight capsule inside the coffin armor. The self-diagnostic showed much more deterioration than he would have expected. Half the circuits were dead, and file after file was corrupt. But he brought up the calendar, and a fiber fed the pixy image directly into the same neural circuits he was using to peer through the cameras. <br>&#x201c;Pox! Thirty-five years. Rania&#x2019;s not back yet? Any signals?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I have not heard, Liege. There is something that may be a signal. I would have prevented them from thawing you, if it were not significant.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So tell me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;An astronomer has detected massive energy discharges erupting from the Diamond Star. So it looks like your Princess arrived there years ago, and we are seeing now the result of some sort of macro-scale engineering. The data are ambiguous, and the Order thought you would want, with your own eyes, to look the data over and draw your own conclusion. Was I right to wake you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Damn right, and thank you for asking. Have the astronomer send his data into the coffin. I can tell you the input-output registers.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather you thawed out fully.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My brain is working. What else do I need?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There has been a lot of wire corruption since you slumbered, Liege, and the Order made laws saying certain messages have to be delivered in person, naked eye, naked ear. Nobody uses or trusts the kind of interface implants you and I have.&#x201d; <br>Montrose was not just surprised; he was shocked. His Cliometric calculations had not anticipated such a radical change in the basic social and technological patterns. One more thing to look into before he slumbered again. He said wryly: &#x201c;Relicts already, eh?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;A quarter century is a long time. And they insist I wear clothing, like an unevolved.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You ain&#x2019;t talking aloud, are you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, Liege. Nerve jack. My suit has a short-range emitter.&#x201d; <br>It took a long while for the molecular machinery clustered in the major cell groups in his vital organs, bone marrow, and parasympathetic system to restore him to life. Even through the nerve-block, there was something like growing pains, and his limbs trembled and shuddered. The last thing to happen was that special artificial glands released adrenaline into his system, and implants made of his own jinxed flesh, like the Hunter&#x2019;s organ and Sach&#x2019;s organ of electric eels, flushed with positively charged sodium and jolted his heart into action. Automatic circuits performed a few tests, just as undignified and invasive as anything a doctor would do, but with no bedside manner. Menelaus just gritted his teeth. <br>Montrose came up out of the gel, dripping, a white glass caterpillar-drive pistol in either hand. These 8-megajoule Brownings were waterproof, slightly curved, streamlined tubes of a white glassy substance, made with no moving parts and powered by a radioactive pellet likely to last 4.47 billion years. And they fitted nicely into his hands. (But he still missed his six-pound hand cannon as long as his forearm that he had used for dueling. The old Krupp railgun had been a handsome piece of artillery.) <br>Sir Guiden was still on one knee. He had removed his bulky helm, slung his goggles, and the wire from his skull-jack lay across his neck. <br>Underneath, his hair was close cropped, and he wore a black leathery cap that buckled under his chin. His face was rounder and fleshier than Menelaus remembered from 2501. Was that a touch of gray at the temples? <br>His age was hard to tell, since Sir Guiden sported a full-face tattoo shaped like a double-headed eagle: Wings surrounded his eyes, crooked talons curled on his cheeks, and twin hawk heads bearing crowns tilted left and right over his eyebrows. Montrose thought it one of the ugliest and most absurd decorations imaginable. <br>Montrose said, &#x201c;I was wondering why you stepped in here all in full kit.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because you are known to sleep with guns in your hands, sir. That, and no one else could talk to you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So no one else has implants? The whole idea was that I could thaw my brain up to dehibernation, while leaving the rest of me iced, and that would save on wear and tear. Hurts like the pestilential devil to shock the heart awake, you know. Why couldn&#x2019;t they just use a hand mic? Clip it to the coffin?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The technology is hard to come by, Liege. The automated factories were under Exarchel&#x2019;s control.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What about that motorized ape suit?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You like it?&#x201d; asked Sir Guiden, pleased. <br>&#x201c;May my member get pustules if&#x2019;n I don&#x2019;t! Always wanted future soldiers to dress in roboexoskeletons. But it seems damnified impractical, and I surely don&#x2019;t recall you wearing nothing alike to them when you climbed in your coffin.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I thawed in 2508 and again in 2526 to oversee certain operations.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;War operations?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That, and moving the buried coffins when Rome was burned by orbital mirrors. The Vatican is gone.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How many people killed?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;None. The city was already evacuated due to banner storms of hunger silk. The Consensus insisted that every city have an evac procedure in place, with an aeroscaphe like a lifeboat folded against the side of every house and tower. Lucky they did.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care about that,&#x201d; said Montrose. He planned to have the current events, no matter how dramatic, be ancient history before he woke again. &#x201c;Tell me about my coffins.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Safe. You&#x2019;ll be interested to know I used your money to purchase Cheyenne Mountain from the government of Kansas.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s in Colorado.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;There are six territories in the North American plains region calling themselves the United States of America. I made the land purchase from George Washington of the Government of the United States of America that is based in Topeka.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;George Washington?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;His name was Joua Ja Gomez before he was acclaimed to his position. All the leaders in Kansas become George Washington. He wears a tricornered hat and dresses in red, white, and blue. Very colorful. But Cheyenne Mountain and the surrounding land are now officially a part of the sovereign territory of Malta, and under the government and suzerainty of the Grand Master of the Order.&#x201d; <br>Menelaus wondered how many more centuries the Knights of Malta would continue to hold government meetings, considering that they had not held Malta since Napoleon kicked them off it. They retreated without a fight, having sworn an oath never to raise weapons against other Christians. <br>&#x201c;There is an old buried fortress beneath Cheyenne Mountain,&#x201d; Sir Guiden said, &#x201c;that should last thousands of years. If we move you there secretly, we might be able to endure undisturbed for longer.&#x201d; <br>Menelaus realized that the kneeling man was waiting for permission to get to his feet. &#x201c;Up! You don&#x2019;t have to stand on ceremony with me, or wait for permission to wipe your bottom in the jakes. So who is this <i>we</i>? And why are we going to be holed up a thousand years? The Diamond Star is only fifty light-years away.&#x201d; <br>The armored figure, with a hiss of motors, rose to his feet, spine straight as a rifle barrel. &#x201c;We are. The Sovereign Military Hospitalier Order of Saint John, of Jerusalem, of Rhodes, of Malta, and of Colorado agreed to guard you in your coffin, Your Honor. We took an oath. I personally swore to you. Do you think merely the passage of time will cow me? Ninety men and eight stand without these doors, ready to retaliate upon any who would desecrate holy ground, where the honored dead lay themselves down, waiting.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It was ninety-nine when I went under, not counting you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;One of them, Sir Alof Villiers de l&#x2019;Isle-Adam, during the thaw of 2526 was granted leave to depart the order that he might wed a current girl.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;So why are we talking about a thousand years?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thousands, sir. With an <i>s.</i>&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You ain&#x2019;t gunna tell me, are you? You have to drag this out and keep me on pins and needles.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Liege, there are some things that you must see with your own eyes. The observatory is directly above us, and drawing nigh.&#x201d; <br> <i>2. The Empire of the Air</i> <br>Montrose was pleased, if a little shocked, that Sir Guy allowed him to walk around under the sky. It implied that assassins of the Cryonarchy were no longer seeking his life. <br>The Cryptonarchs had been, at one time, the only people Montrose thought he could trust with the secret of xypotechnology, cryotechnology, and with the power of the antimatter recovered from V886 Centauri, the Diamond Star. They had been his own extended family, grandsons and great-grandsons of cousins and nephews. <br>But the Cryonarchs proved unworthy of the trust Montrose had invested, and had fallen prey to time, to corruption, to weariness. He had removed them from power by the simple expedient of altering the orbital elements of the remaining world supply of antimatter, a few ever-dwindling crystals of anticarbon diamond. These centaurs occupied orbits beyond Neptune, where encounters with particles of normal matter were rare, but not so far as to encounter the paradoxically thicker areas of deeper, transplutonian space, where there was no solar light-pressure to clear particles away. Then Montrose had given the orbital elements to a priest named Thucydides Montrose, along with his latest formulation to create augmented intelligence. <br>Montrose was not much of a churchgoing man himself, but the Roman Catholic Church had been in business two and a half millennia, older than any institution of man. He was wagering that Black del Azarchel, a Spanish Roman Catholic, would not lightly destroy it. <br>Looking up at the heavens, Montrose had the sinking sensation that he might lose that bet. Because there was a second reason why it might be safe to walk around under the naked sky, aside from the remission of the Cryonarchy vendetta against him. Sniper technology must have fallen to a new low. That implied a widespread civilizational collapse. <br>Clouds the hue of iron hid the sky, and drizzle fogged the air. Before him was a cathedral made of gray stone, withered with age, with a rose window like a cyclops eye, and two square bell-steeples rearing like port and starboard conning towers on some motionless ship of stone. <br>Angels with mossy faces stood on posts to either side of iron gates rusted open. The boneyard was beyond. <br>To judge from the names on the tombstones, this place was in England or North America. He assumed he was in the northeastern states, Blondie territory, or what had been back in his day. Outside the walls, he saw deciduous forest, nude and wintry, stretching over hill country. Directly beyond the cathedral gates, a trail of smaller trees ran straight downhill, but there were not even fragments of asphalt or macadam present to show if there had once been a motorcar road there. <br>Behind the cathedral and its outbuildings were structures he did not recognize, tall metal-sided towers topped with windowless domes that looked a bit like grain silos. Above them, hanging in the air were long streamers, hundreds of yards tall, rippling slightly in the rainy breeze. They were made of blue gray material, semitransparent, and were almost invisible against the cloudy background. They looked like collectors gathering particles out of the air and drawing them down for storage in the silos. <br>Overhead, huge, imposing, larger than a submarine, hung an airship. Sir Guiden raised his hand. The ship descended, but Montrose could see neither ground crew nor docking tower. <br>The air vessel needed none. From a hatch in the bottom gondola stretched many long snakelike tendrils or whips of metal. Guided by some unseen intelligence, they reached down and formed man-sized loops. The upper length of the tendrils flexed and moved, expanding and contracting to compensate as the wind made the airship roll and yaw. The low...</p><h2>Probable Sons (Rare Collector Series)</h2><p>Probable Sons etches into our hearts the importance of forgiveness and reconciliation.

All these things and more are revealed in the objects that men and women use and wear on and around their bodies. And those who can perceive and understand the subtle meanings of these richly elaborated, finely crafted, and beautiful things are the richer for it. Among the world&#39;s finest private collections of ethnic jewelry is that of Colette and Jean-Pierre Ghysels. Formed over the course of more than thirty years of dedicated world travel, conscientious trekking, and trading, the Ghysels&#39; collection has, until now, not been available for viewing except to the couple&#39;s friends and selected scholars. Never exhibited extensively, never published in any comprehensive way, the collection has remained carefully protected in Brussels. Published here for the first time, the Ghysels Collection comes to light in brilliant photographs - made especially for this book - by John Bigelow Taylor and accompanied by a thoughtful and wide-ranging introductory text by a Belgian scholar, the art historian France Borel. Among the four hundred stunning color reproductions from the collection are pieces from every corner of the globe - Africa, the Middle East, the mountain kingdoms of Asia, India, the golden triangle, Indonesia and Malaysia, the Philippines, China and Japan, Oceania, and the Americas. The materials of which they are made cover an enormously wide array: gold, silver, brass, bronze, and iron; precious and semiprecious gems such as carnelian, turquoise, and amber; animal fur, bones, teeth,and feathers; shell, ivory, wood, leather, stone, glass, seeds, plant fibers, and clay. The range of sizes, forms, and craft techniques is equally amazing.

Well, once. But that was a mistake. I'll tell you about it later. The thing is, I got off on it. I really enjoyed it.<br> It's like when you hear serial killers say they feel no regret, no remorse for all the people they killed. I was like that. Loved it. I didn't care how long it took either, because I was in no hurry. I'd wait until they were totally in love with me. Till the big saucer eyes were looking at me. I loved the shock on their faces. Then the glaze as they tried to hide how much I was hurting them. And it was legal. I think I<br> killed a few of them. Their souls, I mean. It was their souls I was after. I know I came close a couple of times. But don't worry, I got my comeuppance. That's why I'm telling you this. Justice was done. Balance has been restored. The same thing happened to me, only worse. Worse because it happened to me. I feel purged now, you see. Cleansed. I've been punished, so it's okay to talk about it all. At least that's how it seems to me. I carried the guilt of my crimes around with me for years after I stopped drinking. I couldn't even look at a girl, much less believe I deserved to converse with one. Or maybe I was just afraid that they'd see through me. Either way, after getting into Alcoholics Anonymous, I didn't even kiss a girl for five years. Seriously. Not so much as holding hands.<br> I meant business.<br> I think I always knew deep down I had a drinking problem. I just never got around to admitting it. I drank purely for effect. But then, as far as I was concerned, wasn't everyone doing the same thing? I started to realize something was wrong when I began to get beaten up. My mouth always got me into trouble, of course. I'd go up to the biggest guy in the place and look up his nostrils and call him a faggot. And then when he'd head-butt me, I'd say, "Call that a headbutt?" So the guy would do it again harder. The second time I'd have less to say. One of my "victims" stuck my head on an electric cooker ring. In Limerick. Stab City. I was lucky to get out of that house alive. He'd done it, though, because I'd been taking the pith out of hiths listhp. Maybe that's why I moved on to girls. More sophisticated, doncha know. And girls wouldn't beat me up. They'd just stare at me in disbelief and shock.<br> Their eyes, you see.<br> All the pretense and rules dissolved away. There was just the two of us and the pain. All those intimate moments, every little sigh, those gentle touches, the lovemaking, the confidences, the orgasms, the attempted orgasms-all mere fuel. The deeper in they were, the more beautiful they looked when the moment came.<br> And I lived for the moment. I was working freelance in advertising all through this period in London. As an art director. A contradiction in terms if ever there was one. It's what I still do today. Strangely, I<br> was always able to get money. Even in art school, I got a grant because my dad had just retired and I suddenly became eligible. And after that I got job after job without too much trouble.<br> I never looked like a drunk, I just was one, and anyway in those days advertising was a far more boozy affair than it is today. Because I was freelance, I could be my own man, so to speak, and I would keep myself busy by ensuring I had dates lined up. None of the girls were supposed to know this. The idea was to have an impressive queue so that when one girl neared maturity-usually after about three or four dates with some phone calls in between-another would be introduced. Then as one went onto the scrap heap, a new one would take her place. Nothing unusual about my method, everyone did it. But I enjoyed it so much. Not the sex or even the conquest, but the causing of pain.<br> It was after my crazy night with Pen (more on that in a minute) that I realized I had found my niche in life. Somehow I was able to lure these creatures into my lair. Half the time I was trying to push them away, but it had just the opposite effect. And the fact that they were attracted to a piece of shit like me made me hate them even more than if<br> they'd laughed in my face and walked away. As for looks? I'm nothing special, but I'm told I have beautiful eyes. Eyes from which nothing but truth could possibly seep.<br> They say the sea is actually black and that it merely reflects the blue sky above. So it was with me. I allowed you to admire yourself in my eyes. I provided a service. I listened<br> and listened and listened. You stored yourself in me.<br> Nothing had ever felt so right to me. If I'm honest, even today I miss hurting. I'm not cured of it, but I don't set out to systematically dismantle like I used to. I don't miss the booze half as much. Oh, to hurt again. Since those heady days I heard an adage that seems to apply here: "Hurt people hurt people."<br> I see now that I was in pain and wanted others to feel it, too. This was my way of communicating. I'd meet the women the first night and get the obligatory phone number and then after another couple of days, making them sweat a little, I'd call and be all nervous. They loved that. I'd ask them out and pretend I hardly ever did "this kind of thing" and say that I hadn't been out a lot in London because I didn't really know the scene. This was true, though, because all I used to do was get out of my head in local bars around Camberwell.<br> We'd agree to meet somewhere. I liked Greenwich, with the river and the boats and of course the pubs. And it had a great boyfriend/girlfriend feel. Nice and respectable. I'd be half out of it before we even met, but I'd be witty and charming and boyish and shaking. Trying to put me at ease, they'd smile and comment on my trembling, thinking I was nervous to create a good impression. Because I wasn't getting in enough booze, my very being would shudder. I'd have to order two large Jamesons at the counter for her every half lager. I'd down the Jimmys without her seeing and then on with the show.<br> Lovely.<br> I didn't really care if I got them into bed or not. I just wanted some company while I got pissed, while I waited for the courage to hurt to well up in me. And they seemed pleased because I wasn't trying to grope them. Sometimes I would. But mostly I'd be fairly well behaved. This would go on for a few dates. In the meantime I would encourage them to tell me about themselves.<br> This is very important for the successful moment later. The more they confided and invested in you, the deeper the shock and the more satisfying the moment at the end. So, I'd be told of their dog's habits, their teddy bear's names, their father's moods, their mother's fears. Did I like kids? How many brothers and sisters did I have? A sitcom I had to sit through. But it was okay, because I knew I'd be writing her out of the series.<br> She'd talk and talk and talk, and I'd nod. Raise a strategic eyebrow. Grimace when necessary. Guffaw or feign shock, whatever was required. I'd watch people in conversation and record their facial expressions. Interest: Raise one eyebrow and raise or lower the other depending on the conversation.<br> Attraction: Try to blush. Not easy, this (thoughts of what I was going to do to her later helped). And a blush usually begot a blush. That is, if I could muster a blush, she was more than likely to blush back. Sympathy: Crinkle the forehead and nod gently. Charmed: Cock your head to one side and smile apologetically. I'd supply these prefab masks on cue. It was easy. It was enjoyable. Guys did it all the time to get laid. I did it to get even. Unkind to Womankind. That was my mission. Around this time I discovered the meaning of the word "misogynist." I remember thinking it hilarious that it had "Miss" as a prefix.<br> All I know is, I felt better when I saw someone else in pain. But of course they would often hide how much I had hurt them. Yes, it was a challenge in itself to help her externalize her feelings, but also bloody frustrating to have gone to all that trouble and then not be able to enjoy a dramatic playback. That's why it became necessary to condense everything into the one demonstrative moment.<br> Sophie was from South London. She used to do the wardrobe for Angus Brady on the comedy show Aren't You Glad to See Me? I met her at a Camberwell College of Arts party that I had crashed. After her, there was that designer girl-whose name I honestly can't remember-who I'm sure I hurt very deeply because she never called me back. Funny that, because even though I never met her again or even heard her say another word, I knew she had it bad.<br> How do I know?<br> I know.<br> There was Jenny. She was the one who threw the beer in my face. I was thrilled to have had a hand in causing so much rage.<br> Then came Emily. But she doesn't really count because she was as good if not better at whatever this is than I was. I kind of fell for her. Laura was somewhere in there. An ex- band publicist with a superb arse that had survived a young daughter. I woke up one morning and there was an eight-year-old girl watching as I tried to extricate myself from the freckled tentacles of her comatose mother. And then after she guilted me into walking her to school, I got the feeling that mother and daughter made full use of the men that passed through their lives. Like the Native American and the Buffalo, The Eskimo and the Seal, The Welfare Mother and Me.<br> And the one who started it all.<br> Penelope Arlington. I'd been going out with her for four and a half years. Long time. She'd been nice to me. Nicer to me than any other girl had ever been. When I spoke, she turned her head toward me and seemed to abandon herself to the meaning of my words. I liked that. It was only much later that I found out she was terrible in bed. At the time I thought she was wanton. She wasn't. But she's the one I regret hurting the most. Why? Because she didn't deserve it. Not that the others did, but she wouldn't have left me if I hadn't ripped her apart. And I needed her to leave me because she was getting in the way of my drinking.<br> And one night I just cracked up. It'd been bubbling for ages. Simmer, simmer, bubble, stew . . . gurgle. I got completely fizzingly drunk and this whole chain of events began to rattle. Why would anyone set out to break the heart of someone he loved? Why would anyone intentionally cause that kind of pain?<br> Why did people kill each other?<br> Because they enjoyed it. Was it really that simple? To achieve a soul-shattering, it is better if the perpetrator has been through the same experience. Hurt people hurt people more skillfully. An expert heartbreaker knows the effect of each incision. The blade slips in barely noticed, the pain and the apology delivered at the same time.</p><h2>Listen!

Its sweeping narrative and cast of wildly colorful characters takes you behind the scenes of a London auction house, into the secret operations of a powerful art dealer, to a flamboyant eighteenth-century-style dinner party, and into a modest living room in Berlin, among many other unexpected settings.<br><br> In <i>The Improbability of Love</i> we meet Annie McDee, thirty-one, who is working as a chef for two rather sinister art dealers. Recovering from the end of a long-term relationship, she is searching in a neglected secondhand shop for a birthday present for her unsuitable new lover. Hidden behind a rubber plant on top of a file cabinet, a grimy painting catches her eye. After spending her meager savings on the picture, Annie prepares an elaborate birthday dinner for two, only to be stood up. <br><br>The painting becomes hers, and as it turns out, Annie has stumbled across a lost masterpiece by one of the most important French painters of the eighteenth century. But who painted this masterpiece is not clear at first. Soon Annie finds herself pursued by interested parties who would do anything to possess her picture. For a gloomy, exiled Russian oligarch, an avaricious sheikha, a desperate auctioneer, and an unscrupulous dealer, among others, the painting embodies their greatest hopes and fears. In her search for the painting&#x2019;s identity, Annie will unwittingly uncover some of the darkest secrets of European history&#x2014;as well as the possibility of falling in love again.<br><br>Irreverent, witty, bittersweet, <i>The Improbability of Love</i> draws an unforgettable portrait of the London art scene, but it is also an exuberant and unexpected journey through life&#x2019;s highs and lows and the complexities of love and loss.&nbsp;</p></p><p><b>HANNAH ROTHSCHILD</b>&nbsp;is the author of <i>The Baroness: The Search for Nica, the Rebellious Rothschild</i>.

At noon, metal barriers were erected to keep a central walkway clear and at 4 p.m. two uniformed Monachorum doormen rolled out a thick red carpet from the fluted Doric columns all the way to the edge of the pavement. The sun beat down on the crowd, and the auction house, as a gesture of good will, handed out free bottles of water and ice-lollies. As Big Ben struck six mournful chimes, the police diverted normal traffic and sent two mounted officers and eight on foot to patrol the street. The paparazzi, carrying step ladders, laptops and assorted lenses, were corralled into a small pen to one side, where they peered longingly through the door at three television crews and various accredited journalists who had managed to secure passes to cover the event from inside.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; a passer-by asked a member of the crowd. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re selling that picture, you know, the one on the news,&#x201d; explained Felicia Speers, who had been there since breakfast. &#x201c;<i>The Impossibility of Love</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>The Improbability of Love</i>,&#x201d; corrected her friend Dawn Morelos. &#x201c;Improbability,&#x201d; she repeated, rolling the syllables slowly over her tongue.</p><p>&#x201c;Whatever. Everyone knows what I&#x2019;m talking about,&#x201d; said Felicia, laughing.</p><p>&#x201c;Are they expecting trouble?&#x201d; asked the passer-by, looking from the police horses to the auction house&#x2019;s burly security guards.</p><p>&#x201c;Not trouble&#x2014;just everyone who&#x2019;s anyone,&#x201d; said Dawn, holding up her smartphone and an autograph book that had the words &#x201c;Rock and Royalty&#x201d; embossed in gold lettering across its front.</p><p>&#x201c;All this hullaballoo for a picture?&#x201d; asked the passer-by.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not just any old artwork, is it?&#x201d; said Felicia. &#x201c;You must have read about it?&#x201d;<br><br>At the top of the broad steps of Monachorum four young women in black dresses and high-heeled shoes stood holding iPads waiting to check off names. This was an invitation-only event. From certain vantage points, the crowd outside could just glimpse the magnificent interiors. Formerly the London seat of the Dukes of Dartmouth, Monachorum&#x2019;s building was one of Europe&#x2019;s grandest surviving Palladian palaces. Its hallway was large enough to park two double-decker buses side by side. The plaster ceiling, a riot of putti and pulchritudinous mermaids, was painted in pinks and golds. An enormous staircase, wide enough for eight horsemen to ride abreast, took the visitor upstairs to the grand salesroom, an atrium, its walls lined with white and green marble and top lit by three rotunda. It was, in many ways, quite unsuitable for hanging and displaying works of art; it did, nevertheless, create a perfect storm of awe and desire.<br><br>In a side room, two dozen impeccably turned-out young men and women were being given their final instructions. Luckily, on this hottest of nights, the air-conditioning kept the room a steady eighteen degrees. The chief auctioneer and mastermind of the sale, Earl Beachendon, dressed for the evening in black tie, stood before them. He spoke firmly and quietly in a voice honed by eight generations of aristocratic fine living and assumed superiority. Beachendon had been educated at Eton and Oxford but, owing to his father&#x2019;s penchant for the roulette table, the eighth Earl was the first member of his illustrious family to have sought regular employment.</p><p>Earl Beachendon appraised his team. For the past four weeks they had rehearsed, anticipating all eventualities from a broken heel to an attempted assassination. With the world&#x2019;s media in attendance and many of the auction house&#x2019;s most important clients gathered in one place, it was essential that events were managed with the precision of a finely tuned Swiss clock. This evening was a game changer in the history of the art market: everyone expected the world record for a single painting to be smashed.</p><p>&#x201c;The attention of the world&#x2019;s media is on us,&#x201d; Beachendon told his rapt audience. &#x201c;Hundreds of thousands of pairs of eyes will be watching. One small mistake will turn triumph into disaster. This is not just about Monachorum, our bonuses or the sale of one painting. This event will reflect on an industry worth over $100 billion annually and our handling of this evening will reverberate across time and continents. I don&#x2019;t need to remind you that this is an international arena. It&#x2019;s time that our contribution to the wealth and health of nations is recognised.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No pressure, my Lord,&#x201d; someone quipped.</p><p>Earl Beachendon ignored his minion. &#x201c;According to our extensive research, your respective charges will be the highest bidders&#x2014;it is up to each of you to nurture, cajole and encourage them to go that little bit further. Convince them that greatness lies in acquisition; excite their curiosity and competitive urges. Use every weapon in your arsenal. Bathe them in a sea of perfectly judged unctuousness. Remind each of them how unique, how indispensable, how talented, how rich they are and, most importantly, that it is only here at this house that their brilliant eye and exquisite taste are appreciated and understood. For one night, forget friendship and morals: concentrate only on winning.&#x201d;</p><p>Beachendon looked along the line of faces, all flushed with excitement. </p><p>&#x201c;You are each to make your assigned guests feel special. Special with a capital &#x2018;S.&#x2019; Even if they don&#x2019;t succeed in buying what they are after, I want these Ultra-High-Net-Worthers to leave this evening longing to come back, desperate to win the next round. No one must feel like a loser or an also-ran; everyone must feel that some tiny thing conspired against them but next time they will triumph.&#x201d;</p><p>Beachendon walked up the line of employees looking from one to another. For them the evening was an exciting experience with a potential bonus; for him it boiled down to penury and pride.</p><p>&#x201c;Now remember, particularly the ladies, you are expected to serve and delight. I leave the interpretation of &#x2018;serve and delight&#x2019; entirely up to each of you, but discretion is the name of the game.&#x201d; Nervous laughter rippled through the ranks.</p><p>&#x201c;As I read out the names of the guests I would like their minders to step forward. You should all be familiar with your charge&#x2019;s appearance, likes, dislikes and peccadillos.&#x201d; Beachendon paused before offering his well-practised, deliberately politically incorrect joke: &#x201c;No offering alcohol to Muslims or ham sandwiches to Jews.&#x201d;</p><p>His audience laughed obediently.</p><p>&#x201c;Who is looking after Vlad Antipovsky and Dmitri Voldakov?&#x201d;</p><p>Two young women, one in tight-fitting black taffeta, the other in a backless green silk dress, raised their hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Venetia and Flora, remember, given the chance, these two men will rip each other&#x2019;s throats out. We have managed to keep their personal security to a minimum and have asked them to leave their firearms at home: prevention is our best policy. Keep them apart.

He was wearing a pink velvet suit and his hair was coiffed in a style once known as a duck&#x2019;s arse.</p><p>Beachendon groaned. &#x201c;More subtlety, please&#x2014;the minister might be of that &#x2018;persuasion,&#x2019; but he doesn&#x2019;t like to be reminded in public.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought I might talk about the ballet&#x2014;he loves the ballet.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Stick to football and cinema,&#x201d; Beachendon instructed. </p><p>&#x201c;Who is looking after Mr. M. Power Dub-Box?&#x201d;</p><p>In recent months, the world&#x2019;s most successful rapper had surprised the art world by buying several iconic works of art. Standing at nearly seven foot tall, weighing 250 lbs. and flanked by an entourage of black- suited minders and nearly naked women, Mr. M. Power Dub-Box was unmissable and, apparently, unbiddable. His behaviour, fuelled by various substances and pumped up by infamy, frequently led to arrests but, as yet, no convictions. Two large men in black tie stepped forward. Vassily was a former Russian middleweight boxing champion and Elmore was an ex-Harvard sports scholar.</p><p>Looking at the towering men, Beachendon offered a silent thank you to Human Resources for hiring these colossi in a world populated by fine-boned aesthetes.</p><p>&#x201c;Moving on.

The last thing he needs is a demented Boston Red Sox fan drawing attention to the fact that he can&#x2019;t afford this picture. Dotty, you are the only person here whose mission it is <i>not</i> to let Stevie Brent buy. According to our sources he has negative equity of $4 billion. I don&#x2019;t care if he sticks his arm up at the beginning, but sit on his paddle when the bidding gets above two hundred million pounds.&#x201d;</p><p>Dotty left to locate her blue taffeta ball gown.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh and Dotty,&#x201d; Beachendon called after her. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t offer him Coca- Cola&#x2014;he shorted the stock far too soon&#x2014;it&#x2019;s up eighteen per cent.&#x201d;</p><p>Earl Beachendon continued through his list of VIPs, making sure that each was linked to an appropriate minder.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Appledore?

Do your best.&#x201d;<br><br>Mrs. Appledore&#x2019;s limousine was making slow progress. The drive from Claridge&#x2019;s to Houghton Street normally took ten minutes, but there were roadworks and diversions in place and traffic had slowed to a crawl around Berkeley Square. On this unusually warm July evening. Londoners, convinced that this was the first and last glimpse of sun, spilled out of pubs and on to pavements. Men took off their jackets, revealing dark damp patches under their arms, while women wore sundresses showing off pink prawn-like arms and legs. At least they look reasonably cheerful for once, Mrs. Appledore thought. The British are so dreary and taciturn during winter. As her car crept up Berkeley Street, she wondered if this would be her last great sale. She was eighty next year and her annual trip to the London auctions was losing its sheen. Once she knew everyone in the saleroom; more importantly, everyone knew her.</p><p>Mrs. Appledore kept her eyes fixed on the future but aspired to the manners and modus operandi of the past. She was born Inna Pawlokowski in Poland in 1935, and her entire family was murdered by Soviet troops in the Katyn Forest massacre. Cared for by nuns for the rest of the war, the young Inna was then sent, with three thousand fellow orphans, to America in 1948. She met her future husband Yannic on the refugee boat, the <i>Cargo of Hope</i>, and although they were only thirteen years old, he proposed as they passed the Statue of Liberty. She promised to bear him six children (she carried nine) and he vowed to make them both millionaires (his estate, when he died in 1990, was valued at $6 billion). On the day of their marriage in 1951, Inna and Yannic changed their names to Melanie and Horace Appledore and never again uttered a word of Polish. Their first business, started the day after their wedding, was a hire company that rented suits and shoes to impoverished immigrants needing to look smart for job interviews. Soon Appledore Inc. expanded into properties, sweat-shops and then private equity. Knowing from personal experience that immigrants worked far harder than natives, the Appledores provided seed funding for start-ups in return for a slice of the equity plus interest on capital. Thanks to the Displaced Persons Act, wave after wave of immigrants arrived on American shores and the Appledores helped and fleeced Europeans, Mexicans, Koreans, West Indians and Vietnamese. By the turn of the new century, Melanie and Horace owned small but significant and highly profitable stakes in family businesses across all fifty states.</p><p>Melanie understood that money alone did not guarantee a seat at the top table. Determined to make her mark on the upper echelons of Park Avenue society, she knew she needed to learn about standards and expectations in order to be part of a seamless flow of gentility and accepted behaviour. To this end, she employed Nobel Prize winners, museum directors and society ladies fallen on hard times to teach her every subject that would help her progress. She learned how to arrange silver at a table; about grape varieties; artistic movements; the difference between allegro and staccato; the amount to tip a duke&#x2019;s butler; which way to turn at dinner; and the direction of travel for a...</p></p><h2>Encyclopaedia of Typefaces</h2><p>For over 50 years, <i>Encyclopaedia of Typeface</i>s<b> </b>has been the dominant typeface guide and now the internationally celebrated work is published in a new 55thAnniversary edition.<br> <br> With over 2,000 type faces arranged alphabetically and into three sections- Romans, Lineales and Scripts- this is the most accessible and easy-to-use edition yet.

In Extremis, Rain and Delilah had been pitted against each other yet again, this time not by professional affiliations but by personal circumstances. Once again, their relationship proved more durable than the forces arrayed against them -- so much so, in fact, that when the book ended I imagined them living harmoniously together in Paris (or at least with whatever level of harmony is achievable when one partner in a romance is a contract killer and the other a Mossad operative). </p><p>So at the outset of <i>The Killer Ascendant</i>, I imagined Rain not just trying to get out of the life, but actually making progress, both body and mind. And then I imagined what would happen if something not just dragged him back in, but outright blasted him all the way back into the heart of darkness he'd been gradually leaving behind. Something like... Dox, getting kidnapped. With his life forfeit unless Rain carried our three "natural causes" hits as the kidnappers demanded. What would Rain do to save his friend? How far would he go? What would happen to him if he unleashed the killer inside himself, the very killer he'd been trying so hard to suppress? </p><p>Some of this thinking was spurred by an interesting conversation I had with my friend Marc MacYoung of No Nonsense Self Defense (nnsd.com -- bring a cup of coffee, you'll be there for a while). Marc had told me about his own efforts to get out of the life -- what was holding him back, what kept him going, what went wrong and what right -- and though I won't spoil anything here, I will say that Rain's insights in the last few pages of the book owe much to the truth of what Marc told me about what it means to take on the deadliest, most ruthless, most resourceful aspect of your own personality. The civilian you want to be, going up against the killer you are? A horrifying mismatch. But Marc found a way, and maybe Rain can, too (at least until the next book in the series, <i>The Detachment</i>). But how?

An accomplished radio personality in Britain, he has written a highly acclaimed series of adaptations for Radio 4 of Herodotus&#39;s &#34;Histories&#34; and Virgil&#39;s &#34;Aeneid,&#34; to be followed by Homer&#39;s &#34;Iliad&#34; and &#34;Odyssey,&#34; and is the author of the novels &#34;The Bone Hunter,&#34; &#34;Slave of My Thirst,&#34; and &#34;Lord of the Dead,&#34;The author of Lord of the Dead (1995), the story of the wildly bipolar Lord Byron becoming ruler of the planet's vampires at age 19, returns with a sequel and a fresh look at London's bloodsuckers. The story opens as a satirically rip-roaring 19th-century boy's adventure modeled on Gunga Din. A small group of ramrod British soldiers attack a temple of Kali high up in the Himalayas, only to find themselves facing Russian zombie/vampires enthralled by the goddess of destruction-and-bloodlust: She takes the form of a ravishingly beautiful vision of sexual horror named Lilah, who later turns up in London. The very amusing first 70 pages--as stiff-lipped British noncoms battle flesh-eating ghouls, and as Dr. John Eliot, also in India, investigates a horrible infection that melts brains and wastes the body, as well as a princely fortune that suddenly vanishes--are worth the ticket price. Eliot's research eventually sets him on Lilah's trail. Back in London, he's joined by theater manager Bram Stoker, who has not yet written Dracula but becomes knowledgeable about vampires while playing muddle-brow Watson to Eliot's Holmes. Eliot is enjoined by a young actress, Miss Lucy Ruthven, to look into her brother Arthur's murder and the disappearance of her guardian, Sir George Mowberley. The two men had been heading a parliamentary bill that would have a major impact on India. Trailing the lost jewels of Kalikshutra at last leads Eliot to Lilah and to a ghastly facedown with this supremely corrupted immortal who bathes in blood in a golden tub. Then come the real surprises--and Byron's return. The Victorian voice used throughout may have been fun to mimic, but Holland's own voice would have given him more intensity. Even Dracula's epistolary style can stultify. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She shows us a brave, powerfully intelligent woman who suffered from a terrifying chronic illness and wrestled with the contradictions of her own character.</p><p>&#34;Woolf&#39;s story is reformulated by each generation,&#34; writes Hermione Lee, a professor of English literature. But her richly human portrait, so respectful of the complexities of her subject&#39;s life, seems unlikely to be surpassed. Lee extricates Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) from clich�s about madness and modernism to reveal a vigorous artist whose work is politically probing as well as psychologically delicate. She makes brilliant use of the formidable Woolf archives to let the writer speak directly to us, then comments shrewdly on her words&#39; hidden significances. Biographies don&#39;t get much better than this.While Virginia Woolf -- one of our century's most brilliant and mercurial writers -- has had no shortage of biographers, none has seemed as naturally suited to the task as Hermione Lee. Subscribing to Virginia Woolf's own belief in the fluidity and elusiveness of identity, Lee comes at her subject from a multitude of perspectives, producing a richly layered portrait of the writer and the woman that leaves all of her complexities and contradictions intact. Such issues as sexual abuse, mental illness, and suicide are brought into balance with the immensity of her literary achievement, her heroic commitment to her work, her generosity and wit, and her sanity and strength.<p>It is not often that biography offers the satisfactions of great fiction -- but this is clearly what Hermione Lee has achieved. Accessible, intelligent, and deeply pleasurable to read, her Virginia Woolf will undoubtedly take its place as the standard biography for years to come.</p></p><h2>Christmas in My Heart, Vol. 9: A Treasury of Timeless Christmas Stories (Focus on the Family Presents)</h2><p>Gather the family together.

Between them they have five children, six grandchildren, and three Labradors.<b>Chapter 1</b><p>In a broad valley, at the foot of a sloping hillside, beside a clear bubbling stream, Tom was building a house. </p><p>The walls were already three feet high and rising fast. The two masons Tom had engaged were working steadily in the sunshine, their trowels going <i>scrape, slap</i> and then <i>tap, tap</i> while their laborer sweated under the weight of the big stone blocks. Tom&#x2019;s son Alfred was mixing mortar, counting aloud as he scooped sand onto a board. There was also a carpenter, working at the bench beside Tom, carefully shaping a length of beech wood with an adz. </p><p>Alfred was fourteen years old, and tall like Tom. Tom was a head higher than most men, and Alfred was only a couple of inches less, and still growing. They looked alike too: both had light-brown hair and greenish eyes with brown flecks. People said they were a handsome pair. The main difference between them was that Tom had a curly brown beard, whereas Alfred had only a fine blond fluff. The hair on Alfred&#x2019;s head had been that color once, Tom remembered fondly. Now that Alfred was becoming a man, Tom wished he would take a more intelligent interest in his work, for he had a lot to learn if he was to be a mason like his father; but so far Alfred remained bored and baffled by the principles of building. </p><p>When the house was finished it would be the most luxurious home for miles around. The ground floor would be a spacious undercroft, for storage, with a curved vault for a ceiling, so that it would not catch fire. The hall, where people actually lived, would be above, reached by an outside staircase, its height making it hard to attack and easy to defend. Against the hall wall there would be a chimney, to take away the smoke of the fire. This was a radical innovation: Tom had only ever seen one house with a chimney, but it had struck him as such a good idea that he was determined to copy it. At one end of the house, over the hall, there would be a small bedroom, for that was what earls&#x2019; daughters demanded nowadays&#x2014;they were too fine to sleep in the hall with the men and the serving wenches and the hunting dogs. The kitchen would be a separate building, for every kitchen caught fire sooner or later, and there was nothing for it but to build them far away from everything else and put up with lukewarm food. </p><p>Tom was making the doorway of the house. The doorposts would be rounded to look like columns&#x2014;a touch of distinction for the noble newlyweds who were to live here. With his eye on the shaped wooden template he was using as a guide, Tom set his iron chisel obliquely against the stone and tapped it gently with the big wooden hammer. A small shower of fragments fell away from the surface, leaving the shape a little rounder. He did it again. Smooth enough for a cathedral. </p><p>He had worked on a cathedral once&#x2014;Exeter. At first he had treated it like any other job. He had been angry and resentful when the master builder had warned him that his work was not quite up to standard: he knew himself to be rather more careful than the average mason. But then he realized that the walls of a cathedral had to be not just good, but <i>perfect</i>. This was because the cathedral was for God, and also because the building was so <i>big</i> that the slightest lean in the walls, the merest variation from the absolutely true and level, could weaken the structure fatally. Tom&#x2019;s resentment turned to fascination. The combination of a hugely ambitious building with merciless attention to the smallest detail opened Tom&#x2019;s eyes to the wonder of his craft. He learned from the Exeter master about the importance of proportion, the symbolism of various numbers, and the almost magical formulas for working out the correct width of a wall or the angle of a step in a spiral staircase. Such things captivated him. He was surprised to learn that many masons found them incomprehensible. </p><p>After a while Tom had become the master builder&#x2019;s right-hand man, and that was when he began to see the master&#x2019;s shortcomings. The man was a great craftsman and an incompetent organizer. He was completely baffled by the problems of obtaining the right quantity of stone to keep pace with the masons, making sure that the blacksmith made enough of the right tools, burning lime and carting sand for the mortar makers, felling trees for the carpenters, and getting enough money from the cathedral chapter to pay for everything. </p><p>If Tom had stayed at Exeter until the master builder died, he might have become master himself; but the chapter ran out of money&#x2014;partly because of the master&#x2019;s mismanagement&#x2014;and the craftsmen had to move on, looking for work elsewhere. Tom had been offered the post of builder to the Exeter castellan, repairing and improving the city&#x2019;s fortifications. It would have been a lifetime job, barring accidents. But Tom had turned it down, for he wanted to build another cathedral. </p><p>His wife, Agnes, had never understood that decision. They might have had a good stone house, and servants, and their own stables, and meat on the table every dinnertime; and she had never forgiven Tom for turning down the opportunity. She could not comprehend the irresistible attraction of building a cathedral: the absorbing complexity of organization, the intellectual challenge of the calculations, the sheer size of the walls, and the breathtaking beauty and grandeur of the finished building. Once he had tasted that wine, Tom was never satisfied with anything less. </p><p>That had been ten years ago. Since then they had never stayed anywhere for very long. He would design a new chapter house for a monastery, work for a year or two on a castle, or build a town house for a rich merchant; but as soon as he had some money saved he would leave, with his wife and children, and take to the road, looking for another cathedral. </p><p>He glanced up from his bench and saw Agnes standing at the edge of the building site, holding a basket of food in one hand and resting a big jug of beer on the opposite hip. It was midday. He looked at her fondly. No one would ever call her pretty, but her face was full of strength: a broad forehead, large brown eyes, a straight nose, a strong jaw. Her dark, wiry hair was parted in the middle and tied behind. She was Tom&#x2019;s soul mate. </p><p>She poured beer for Tom and Alfred. They stood there for a moment, the two big men and the strong woman, drinking beer from wooden cups; and then the fourth member of the family came skipping out of the wheat field: Martha, seven years old and as pretty as a daffodil, but a daffodil with a petal missing, for she had a gap where two milk teeth had fallen out and the new ones had not yet grown. She ran to Tom, kissed his dusty beard, and begged a sip of his bear. He hugged her bony body. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t drink too much, or you&#x2019;ll fall into a ditch,&#x201d; he said. She staggered around in a circle, pretending to be drunk. </p><p>They all sat down on the woodpile. Agnes handed Tom a hunk of wheat bread, a thick slice of boiled bacon and a small onion. He took a bite from the meat and started to peel the onion. Agnes gave the children food and began to eat her own. Perhaps it was irresponsible, Tom thought, to turn down that dull job in Exeter and go looking for a cathedral to build; but I&#x2019;ve always been able to feed them all, despite my recklessness. </p><p>He took his eating knife from the front pocket of his leather apron, cut a slice off the onion, and ate it with a bite of bread. The onion was sweet and stinging in his mouth. Agnes said: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m with child again.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom stopped chewing and stared at her. A thrill of delight took hold of him. Not knowing what to say, he just smiled foolishly at her. After a few moments she blushed, and said, &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t <i>that</i> surprising.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom hugged her. &#x201c;Well, well,&#x201d; he said, still grinning with pleasure. &#x201c;A babe to pull my beard. And I thought the next would be Alfred&#x2019;s.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get too happy yet,&#x201d; Agnes cautioned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s bad luck to name the child before it&#x2019;s born.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom nodded assent. Agnes had had several miscarriages and one stillborn baby, and there had been another little girl, Matilda, who had lived on two years. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like a boy, though,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Now that Alfred&#x2019;s so big. When is it due?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;After Christmas.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom began to calculate. The shell of the house would be finished by first frost, then the stonework would have to be covered with straw to protect it through the winter. The masons would spend the cold months cutting stones for windows, vaults, doorcases and the fireplace, while the carpenter made floorboards and doors and shutters and Tom built the scaffolding for the upstairs work. Then in spring they would vault the undercroft, floor the hall above it, and put on the roof. The job would feed the family until Whitsun, by which time the baby would be a half year old. Then they would move on. &#x201c;Good,&#x201d; he said contentedly. &#x201c;This is good.&#x201d; He ate another slice of onion. </p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m too old to bare children,&#x201d; said Agnes. &#x201c;This must be my last.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom thought about that. He was not sure how old she was, in numbers, but plenty of women bore children at her time in life. However, it was true they suffered more as they grew older, and the babies were not as strong. No doubt she was right. But how would she make certain that she would not conceive again? he wondered. Then he realized how, and a cloud shadowed his sunny mood. </p><p>&#x201c;I may get a good job, in a town,&#x201d; he said, trying to mollify her. &#x201c;A cathedral, or a palace. Then we might have a big house with wood floors, and a maid to help you with the baby.&#x201d; </p><p>Her face hardened, and she said skeptically: &#x201c;It may be.&#x201d; She did not like to hear talk of cathedrals. If Tom had never worked on a cathedral, her face said, she might be living in a town house now, with money saved up and buried under the fireplace, and nothing to worry about. </p><p>Tom looked away and took another bite of bacon. They had something to celebrate, but they were in disharmony. He felt let down. He chewed the tough meat for a while, then he heard a horse. He cocked his head to listen. The rider was coming through the trees from the direction of the road, taking a short cut and avoiding the village. </p><p>A moment later, a young man on a pony trotted up and dismounted. He looked like a squire, a kind of apprentice knight. &#x201c;Your lord is coming,&#x201d; he said. </p><p>Tom stood up. &#x201c;You mean Lord Percy?&#x201d; Percy Hamleigh was one of the most important men in the country. He owned this valley, and many others, and he was paying for the house. </p><p>&#x201c;His son,&#x201d; said the squire. </p><p>&#x201c;Young William.&#x201d; Percy&#x2019;s son, William, was to occupy this house after his marriage. He was engaged to Lady Aliena, the daughter of the earl of Shiring. </p><p>&#x201c;The same,&#x201d; said the squire, &#x201c;And in a rage.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom&#x2019;s heart sank. At the best of times it could be difficult to deal with the owner of a house under construction. An owner in a rage was impossible. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he angry about?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;His bride rejected him.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The earl&#x2019;s daughter?&#x201d; said Tom in surprise. He felt a pang of fear: he had just been thinking how secure his future was. &#x201c;I thought that was settled.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;So did we all&#x2014;except Lady Aliena, it seems,&#x201d; the squire said. &#x201c;The moment she met him, she announced that she wouldn&#x2019;t marry him for all the world and a woodcock.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom frowned worriedly. He did not want this to be true. &#x201c;But the boy&#x2019;s not bad-looking, as I recall.&#x201d; </p><p>Agnes said: &#x201c;As if that made any difference, in her position. If earls&#x2019; daughters were allowed to marry whom they please, we&#x2019;d all be ruled by strolling minstrels and dark-eyed outlaws.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;The girl may yet change her mind,&#x201d; Tom said hopefully. </p><p>&#x201c;She will if her mother takes a birch rod to her,&#x201d; Agnes said. </p><p>The squire said: &#x201c;Her mother&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d; </p><p>Agnes nodded. &#x201c;That explains why she doesn&#x2019;t know the facts of life. But I don&#x2019;t see why her father can&#x2019;t compel her.&#x201d; </p><p>The squire said: &#x201c;It seems he once promised he would never marry her to someone she hated.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;A foolish pledge!&#x201d; Tom said angrily. How could a powerful man tie himself to the whim of a girl in that way? Her marriage could affect military alliances, baronial finances... even the building of this house. </p><p>The squire said: &#x201c;She had a brother, so it&#x2019;s not <i>so</i> important whom she marries.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Even so...&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the earl is an unbending man,&#x201d; the squire went on. &#x201c;He won&#x2019;t go back on a promise, even one made to a child.&#x201d; He shrugged. &#x201c;So they say.&#x201d; </p><p>Tom looked at the low stone walls of the house-to-be. He had not yet saved enough money to keep the family through winter, he realized with a chill. &#x201c;Perhaps the lad will find another bride to share this place with him. He&#x2019;s got the whole county to choose from.&#x201d; </p><p>Alfred spoke in a cracked adolescent voice. &#x201c;By Christ, I think this is him.&#x201d; Following his gaze, they all looked across the field. A horse was coming from the village in a gallop, kicking up a cloud of dust and earth from the pathway. Alfred&#x2019;s oath was prompted by the size as well as the speed of the horse: it was huge. Tom had seen beasts like it before, but perhaps Alfred had not. It was a war-horse, as high at the wither as a man&#x2019;s chin, and broad in proportion. Such war-horses were not bred in England, but came from overseas, and were enormously costly. </p><p>Tom dropped the remains of his bread in the pocket of his apron, then narrowed his eyes against the sun and gazed across the field. The horse had its ears back and nostrils flared, but it seemed to Tom that its head was up, a sign that it was not completely out of control. Sure enough, as it came closer the rider leaned back, hauling on the reins, and the huge animal seemed to slow a little. Now Tom could feel the drumming of its hooves in the ground beneath his feet. He looked around for Martha, thinking to pick her up and put her out of harm&#x2019;s way. Agnes had the same thought. But Martha was not to be seen. </p><p>&#x201c;In the wheat,&#x201d; Agnes said, but Tom had already figured that out and was striding across the site to the edge of the field. He scanned the waving wheat with fear in his heart but he could not see the child. </p><p>The only thing he could think of was to try and slow the horse. He stepped into the path and began to walk toward the charging beast, holding his arms wide. The horse saw him, raised its head for a better look, and slowed perceptibly. Then, to Tom&#x2019;s horror, the rider spurred it on. </p><p>&#x201c;You damned fool!&#x201d; Tom roared, although the rider could not hear. </p><p>That was when Martha stepped out of the field and into the pathway a few yards in front of Tom. </p><p>For an instant Tom stood still in a sick panic. Then he leaped forward, shouting and waving his arms; but this was a war-horse, trained to charge at yelling hordes, and it did not flinch. Martha stood in the middle of the narrow path, staring as if transfixed by the huge beast bearing down on her. There was a moment when Tom realized desperately that he could not get to her before the horse did. He swerved to one side, his arm touching the standing wheat; and at the last instant the horse swerved to the other side. The rise&#x2019;s stirrup brushed Martha&#x2019;s fine hair; a hoof stamped a hole in the ground beside her bare foot; then the horse had gone by, spraying them both with dirt, and Tom snatched her up in his arms and held her tight to his pou...</p></p><h2>Plants of Power: An historical survey of the divine nature of plants and ritual communication through plant helpers to the spiritual world</h2><p>. 1997 revd ed, 88pp</p><p></p><h2>Oblivion America At the Brink</h2><p>Book by Thomas E.

Cronin writes with remarkable subtlety of the frustrations and pathologies of this generation: the excess of drink, the shortage of sex, the insecurity and begrudgery, the painful limitations of cultural life, and the bittersweet pull of exile.

But that past bleeds into the present in a complex murder case that calls into question his own honor...and the crimes committed in the name of God, country, and righteous vengeance.<br><br><b>A Fearsome Doubt<br><br></b>In 1912 Ian Rutledge watched as a man was condemned to hang for the murders of elderly women. Rutledge helped gather the evidence that sent Ben Shaw to the gallows. And when justice was done, Rutledge closed the door on the case. But Shaw was not easily forgotten.<br><br>Now, seven years later, that grim trial returns in the form of Ben Shaw&#x2019;s widow Nell, bringing Rutledge evidence she is convinced will prove her husband&#x2019;s innocence. It&#x2019;s a belief fraught with peril, threatening both Rutledge&#x2019;s professional stature and his faith in his judgment. But there is a darker reason for Rutledge&#x2019;s reluctance. Murder brings him back to Kent where, days earlier, he&#x2019;d glimpsed an all-too-familiar face beyond the leaping flames of a bonfire. Soon an unexpected encounter revives the end of his own war, as the country prepares for a somber commemoration on the anniversary of the Armistice. To battle the unsettled past and the haunted present at the same time is an appalling mandate. <br><br>And the people around him? among them the attractive widow of a friend, a remarkable woman who survived the Great Indian Mutiny; a bitter, dying barrister; and a man whose name he never knew&#x2014;unwittingly compete with the grieving Nell Shaw.

Each of the flights' leaders was imbued with a portion of the titans' vast cosmic powers. Together, these majestic Dragon Aspects committed themselves to thwarting any force that threatened the safety of the WORLD OF WARCRAFT. <br><br>Over ten thousand years ago, a betrayal by the maddened black Dragon Aspect, Deathwing, shattered the strength and unity of the dragonflights. His most recent assault on Azeroth&#x2014;the Cataclysm&#x2014;has left the world in turmoil. At the Maelstrom, the center of Azeroth's instability, former Horde warchief Thrall and other accomplished shaman struggle to keep the world from tearing apart in the wake of Deathwing's attack. Yet a battle also rages within Thrall regarding his new life in the shamanic Earthen Ring, hampering his normally unparalleled abilities. <br><br>Unable to focus on his duties, Thrall undertakes a seemingly menial task from an unexpected source: the mysterious green Dragon Aspect, Ysera. This humble endeavor soon becomes a journey spanning the lands of Azeroth and the timeways of history itself, bringing Thrall into contact with ancient dragonflights. Divided by conflict and mistrust, these dragons have become easy prey to a horrific new weapon unleashed by Deathwing's servants . . . a living nightmare engineered to exterminate Azeroth's winged guardians. <br><br>Of even greater concern is a bleak and terrifying possible future glimpsed by Ysera: the Hour of Twilight. Before this apocalyptic vision comes to pass, Thrall must purge his own doubts in order to discover his purpose in the world and aid Azeroth's dragonflights as they face the Twilight of the Aspects.</p><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling and award-winning author Christie Golden has written more than forty novels and several short stories in the fields of science fiction, fantasy, and horror.

Using a cutting-edge technology called DHI--which stands for both Disney Host Interactive and Daylight Hologram Imaging--Finn Whitman, an Orlando teen, and four other kids are transformed into hologram projections that guide guests through the park. The new technology turns out, however, to have unexpected effects that are both thrilling and scary. Soon Finn finds himself transported in his DHI form into the Magic Kingdom at night. Is it real? Is he dreaming? In book two, the mystery deepens as Finn is contacted by Wayne, an old man he hasn&#39;t heard from in months. Wayne tells Finn that there&#39;s trouble at the Animal Kingdom: the evil Overtakers have gained control of one of the computer servers that will be used to operate Daylight Holographic Imaging there. That means that if any of the holographic hosts fall asleep, they will go into comas-permanently. Then in book three, Finn, Philby, Willa, Charlene, and Maybeck search to find Wayne, who has mysteriously gone missing. Concerned that Wayne has been abducted by the Overtakers, the five kids pick up a major clue from their close friend whose dreams (nightmares, really) often accurately predict the future. Clues from a dream lead the kids into Disney&#39;s Hollywood Studios and Epcot. Each clue seems tied to the last, and with the stakes growing ever higher, what starts out as a puzzle ends up as a fight for survival.</p><p>Ridley Pearson is the award-winning author of multiple adventure series for (young-ish) readers, including The Kingdom Keepers, Steel Trapp, and with Dave Barry, Peter and the Starcatchers.

The character of Tom Kalinske, the brilliant business guru (who&#x2019;d resurrected Barbie, turning a back-of-the-closet, anachronistic doll into a contemporary, billion-dollar phenomenon) tapped to transform Sega from a small-scale Japanese arcade game outfit into a global competitor, is deftly drawn; from the very beginning, he faces a herculean task, not the least of which is his need to bridge the cultural chasm between American consumers and Japanese managers.

Directly in their path was Lisbon, then one of the wealthiest cities in the world and the capital of a vast global empire. Within minutes, much of the city lay in ruins. <br><br>But this was only the beginning. A half hour later, a giant tsunami unleashed by the quake smashed into Portugal&#x2019;s coastline and barreled up the Tagus River, carrying countless thousands out to sea.

To complete Lisbon&#x2019;s destruction, a hellacious firestorm then engulfed the city&#x2019;s shattered remains.

There is Kitty Witham, the plucky English nun who helps her fellow sisters escape from their collapsing convent, and Manoel Portal, the Oratorian priest who flees the burning capital on his broken leg and goes on to write one of the definitive accounts of the disaster.

Written by authors both high and low&#x2014;Dom Jos�, Monsignor Acciai- uoli, the ambassadors of France, Naples, and Prussia, the secretary of the late Count Perelada (who paid for the courier), as well as several merchants and private citizens&#x2014;they were quickly opened and distrib- uted to people of prominence throughout the capital.3 Before long, copies were affixed to city walls, along with hastily produced accounts of the earthquake. In Madrid&#x2019;s principal squares and markets, the reso- nant voices of <i>noveleros </i>(newsmongers) kept the city&#x2019;s largely illiterate population abreast of the latest developments.4<br><br>Perhaps no phrase uttered in the aftermath of the disaster proved more disconcerting to eighteenth-century sensibilities than Dom Jos�&#x2019;s oft-quoted words to the Spanish throne. &#x201c;I am without a House, in a Tent, without Servants, without Subjects, without Money, and with- out Bread,&#x201d; he informed Fernando VI, his brother-in-law, and Maria B�rbara, his older sister. Both were understandably horrified.5 &#x201c;Their Catholic Majesties have been affected with this news as souls like [theirs] should be affected in such terrible calamities,&#x201d; reported a Brit- ish ambassador to Spain, Benjamin Keene.6 According to Keene, &#x201c;the King immediately wrote a Letter to his Sister the Queen of Portugal in the most tender &amp; most generous Terms: offering all in his Power to assist and relieve them; and expressing his great Concern that the Distance deprived Them from applying such immediate Remedies as He could wish.&#x201d;7 &#x201c;We must give a thousand thanks to God,&#x201d; wrote Don Fernando to his stepmother, &#x201c;that the [Portuguese] royal family has successfully escaped from such a great danger.&#x201d; 8<br><br>Within hours, he and Maria B�rbara dispatched their first shipment of aid to Bel�m and &#x201c;gave orders,&#x201d; according to a newspaper account, &#x201c;to supply [the Portuguese] court with everything else that would be wanted.&#x201d;9 &#x201c;They send as much ready money every day as a messenger can carry,&#x201d; wrote Keene. &#x201c;And . . . [Don Fernando&#x2019;s] letter to his sister [Queen Mariana Vit�ria] offers all <i>her </i>King can ask and he can send.&#x201d;10 To facilitate the flow of goods and royal cash, which may have totaled as much as 150,000 pieces of eight or about �37,000, Fernando abolished all tariffs along the Spanish-Portuguese border.11<br><br>It was the opening act of the first international relief effort in world history. In the case of Spain, it was the close familial bonds between the two royal houses that, despite the age-old antagonism between the two Iberian kingdoms, proved decisive. Undoubtedly, the pivotal fac- tor was Maria B�rbara, Spain&#x2019;s Lisbon-born queen. The oldest child of Jo�o V, she was, despite her homeliness, much beloved by her husband, over whom she exercised considerable influence. After ascending the throne in 1746, she had worked tirelessly to improve relations with Portugal, lobbying strenuously for the Treaty of Boundaries, which had eased border tensions in the New World between the two Iberian kingdoms. Later, to the delight of both Portugal and Britain, she supported Spain&#x2019;s neutrality during the early stages of the Seven Years War.12<br><br>But despite the improved relations, the Portuguese refused to embrace Spain&#x2019;s earthquake largesse with open arms. According to Keene, Dom Jos� only accepted the money &#x201c;conditionally&#x201d; and requested that the funds &#x201c;remain in the Hands of the Spanish Treasurer residing in Lisbon&#x201d; until &#x201c;he should have Occasion for Them.&#x201d;13 Pombal must have reasoned that it was better to regard monetary gifts from former adversaries with a degree of caution than run the risk of later feeling obligated to them. The implication is that Portugal did accept some Spanish aid in the form of supplies (though, in at least one case, the Portuguese were forced to return a shipment of clothing because treaty obligations prohibited their importation from Spain).14<br><br>On November 11, the <i>Gaceta de Madrid </i>published the first Spanish account of the earthquake in Portugal. &#x201c;A special news bulletin [<i>un expresso</i>] has been received from Lisbon, that the same earthquake that was felt [here] . . . on the first of the month caused the most pitiful destruction&#x201d; there. &#x201c;Although specific information on the devastation was not yet available, it is said that His Excellency, Count Perelada, the Spanish Ambassador to the Portuguese Court, has perished along with several members of his family.&#x201d;15 One of the few survivors was the count&#x2019;s only son and heir, a lad of about seven.16 Upon hearing the news, Fernando VI appointed the boy a &#x201c;Gentleman-in-Waiting&#x201d; and awarded him &#x201c;an annual pension of 500 gold doubloons&#x201d; out of a sense of gratitude for his father&#x2019;s service to the Crown.17<br><br>Reliable information from Lisbon remained scarce, however. &#x201c;We are stunned at the lack of news,&#x201d; wrote Don Fernando.18 According to Mr. Keene, &#x201c;Count Unh�o [Portugal&#x2019;s ambassador to Spain] is half dead for fear of his father and his daughter. He has not heard a word about either.&#x201d;19 For his part, Keene knew nothing about the condition and whereabouts of Mr. Castres and Mr. Hay&#x2014;though he tried mightily to interpret this as a positive sign. &#x201c;I console myself from this very silence,&#x201d; Keene wrote Castres on November 10, &#x201c;that no harm is personally taken upon you and that your house is situated in such a manner as not to be exposed to the flames which we hear are consuming the miserable remains of what survived the earthquake. . . . Send&nbsp;me good news of yourself and believe the tender sentiments with which I embrace you.&#x201d;20<br><br>By the end of November, most Spaniards knew that the Portuguese capital had been destroyed. At this time, the <i>Mercurio Hist�rico y Pol�tico </i>began its monthly coverage of the Lisbon disaster, modestly offering its readers &#x201c;a brief compendium of the innumerable and miserable ruins and pitiful destruction that the great city and court of Lisbon experienced on November 1, 1755, through the violent collusion of all four elements.&#x201d;21 In November and December, the first pamphlets and books on the disaster were published in Spain. In hard-hit Seville, over fifty titles would appear before the end of the year.22<br><br>Back in Lisbon, the most extraordinary thing about the press coverage was that it occurred at all. The shop that printed the <i>Gazeta de Lisboa, </i>Portugal&#x2019;s only newspaper, was located in the heart of the Baixa on the Rua Nova dos Ferros (as the central section of the Rua Nova dos Mercedores was called) and was almost certainly destroyed.23 Although the November 6 edition of the weekly did appear&#x2014;leading many later to applaud the superhuman efforts of its staff&#x2014;it was almost certainly delayed for several weeks.24 The <i>Gazeta </i>declared on the last page of the November 6 edition,<br><br>The first day of the month will forever be remembered in every country for the earthquakes and fires that ruined a great part of this city; fortunately, the royal coffers and the greater part of the royal property were recovered in the ruins.25<br><br>Such was the entire initial news coverage of the greatest natural disaster in Portuguese history.<br><br>In the edition that followed, on November 13, <i>lisboetas </i>learned that Spain had experienced the same <i>&#x201c;formidavel tremor de Terra&#x201d; </i>as they had and that the cities of C�rdoba, Seville, and C�diz had suffered substantial damage.26 In the coming months, the <i>Gazeta </i>would report on the devastation in the Algarve as well as the damage sustained by several Portuguese cities&#x2014;although almost nothing on Lisbon itself.<br><br>The reasons for this lie not with any lack of interest in the disaster, but with the nature of the <i>Gazeta </i>itself. Created by royal charter in 1715 and still managed by its first editor, the now eighty-five-year-old Jos� Freire Monterroio Mascarenhas, the paper was practically as well as conceptually ill-equipped to cover such a momentous and complex event. Like most European newspapers of the day, the <i>Gazeta</i>&#x2019;s job was to keep the urban elite apprised of distant events as well as the doings of foreign courts. Except for an obligatory and brief accounting of the public activities of the Portuguese royal family and high nobility in the final pages of each issue, the <i>Gazeta </i>did not cover national and local news at all.27 It offered no political commentary and contained no headlines or illustrations, and, as was customary at the time, the most important and arresting stories were almost never featured on the front page.28 The paper was also rigidly controlled by the government&#x2014;becoming, after the disaster, a tool of Pombal, who sought from the start to downplay the impact of the earthquake on Lisbon in order to convince business interests and foreign governments that Portugal had not been destroyed or irreparably damaged.<br><br>If literate <i>lisboetas </i>wished to learn more about the disaster, they (like their Spanish counterparts) would have consulted the growing number of handwritten accounts, letters, and official proclamations that circu- lated among the elite or were plastered to city walls.29 Within weeks, published narratives, poems, sermons, and scientific treatises on the disaster began to appear in Lisbon, Porto, and Coimbra. For the illiter- ate majority, most news on the topic would have been obtained through word of mouth.30<br><br> Beyond The Pyrenees<br><br> On November 10, several couriers left Madrid for Paris and Versailles. Their ride across Castile, Navarre, the Pyrenees, Guyenne, Gascony, and Poitou was colder, wetter, and almost twice as long as the jour- ney from Lisbon to Madrid.31 In the eighteenth century, most overland mail was delivered by coach, but for urgent messages&#x2014;those requir- ing an &#x201c;express&#x201d;&#x2014;an individual rider was used.32 At intervals of around twenty miles, fresh horses were provided at &#x201c;posts,&#x201d; usually taverns or inns. If offered extra money, a rider would increase his speed, normally around five miles per hour, and limit his periods of rest. The courier who carried the news on November 4 from Lisbon to Madrid averaged about 3.8 miles per hour (factoring in periods of sleep and rest) during his 103-hour, 390-mile journey.33 Such efforts were necessary, for the majority of ships in Lisbon&#x2019;s harbor had been detained for inspection or the urgent need to collect people and property.34<br><br>On November 18, the French ambassador&#x2019;s letter (of November 4) arrived at Versailles. Addressed to Louis XV from &#x201c;a field near Lisbon&#x201d; and composed on two small and uncharacteristically plain leaves of paper, it contains almost no punctuation, a testament, Count de Baschi explained, to the enormous strain under which it was produced.<br><br>I have taken advantage of the departure of the courier of the secretary of the Spanish Embassy and [my] first moment of peace to share with you the horrible event which has overwhelmed Lisbon . . . Most of the houses have been destroyed . . . and the fire has yet to complete its consuming of this unfortunate city that will not be rebuilt in a hundred years[.] My house has collapsed like all the others[.] But my people have courageously saved many of my effects[,] but for some chairs beds and two tapestries[,] everything is [beneath the ruins.] I am overjoyed that my life has been saved as well as that of my wife my children and all of my servants[.]<br><br>The Baschis were now living (the ambassador reported) on the grounds of French consul Nicolas Grenier&#x2019;s villa, sitting on pillows in the open air and sleeping in tents fashioned from towels, which somehow provided adequate protection &#x201c;from a violent wind that blows every night.&#x201d;35 Joining them was the surviving son of Count Perelada, whom Baschi had saved from the ruins, in addition to the servants and staff of the Spanish embassy who had followed the ambassador there after Perelada&#x2019;s death.36<br><br>In his memoirs, the Marquis d&#x2019;Argenson, the former French foreign minister, recalled the moment that the &#x201c;awful news&#x201d; that Lisbon had &#x201c;been suddenly swallowed up&#x201d; arrived at Versailles. &#x201c;The engulfed churches, the palaces, the residences of the Portuguese and the foreign ministers&#x2014;what wealth destroyed!&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;We . . . fear bank- ruptcy for our merchants . . . [though] the English, too, will have heavy losses.&#x201d;37<br><br>Similarly distressed was Madame de Pompadour, the king&#x2019;s &#x201c;official chief mistress,&#x201d; who feared for the safety of her sister-in-law and pro- t�g�e, Charlotte-Victoire Le Normant, Count de Baschi&#x2019;s wife. It was Pompadour, after all, who had first brought this younger sister of her own cuckolded husband, Charles-Guillaume Le Normant d&#x2019;�tiolles, to the attention of the king and court. And it was Pompadour who, two years earlier, had secured for Madame de Baschi&#x2019;s husband, Fran�ois (a provincial aristocrat and well-known incompetent), the coveted ambassadorship to Portugal.38 Now she found herself powerless to do anything more than inset a few &#x201c;valuable presents&#x201d; in the shipment of supplies the government was readying to send the Baschis.39<br><br>On November 15, Madame de Baschi composed a letter that would be quoted in newspapers as far away as St. Petersburg. &#x201c;His Majesty has ordered six people, who have confessed to setting fire to the Royal Palace and the Patriarch&#x2019;s house, to be hanged,&#x201d; she wrote, and in addition he &#x201c;has ordered gallows to be erected to terrify such godless people around the city.&#x201d; Not long ago, the king &#x201c;toured the whole city to inspect the damage and endeavored to dig up anything that was possible from underneath the rubble. . . . My husband found his silver plate [in the ruins of our house] . . . only a few pieces have been damaged.&#x201d;40<br><br>This last fact caught the attention of the great and ever-alert Voltaire, indirectly inspiring his greatest masterpiece four years later.41 &#x201c;I see my dear Monsieur from your last letter,&#x201d; the philosopher wrote to a friend on December 9, 1755, &#x201c;that the End of the World and the Last Judgment is not yet come, and since M. Baschi&#x2019;s furniture is in good condition, all is well in Lisbon.&#x201d;42<br><br> ~~<br> Excerpted from&nbsp;<b>This Gulf of Fire </b>by Mark Molesky. Copyright � 2015 by Mark Molesky.

Readers are introduced to the lathe, the methods of attaching wood to it, and (most importantly) turning tools and their proper care and use. Woodturning is arguably the most difficult woodworking discipline because proper technique is so important (a slip or moment of inattention and the project is gone, sometimes flying directly toward one's face). Raffan is a gifted instructor whose years as a production turner have developed a pragmatic style and an economy of motion. By mastering these techniques, one can move on to any style of woodturning.

He begins with the creation myth, when Ninavanhu-Ma, the Great Mother, created the human race. From there, an epic unfolds, an intricate and vivid cultural tapestry populated by gods and mortals, cattle herders and supreme kings, witch doctors, lovers, grave diggers, warriors, and handmaidens. The story continues all the way up to the colonial era, when a Portuguese Kapitanoh and his crew arrive on the African shore.

Full of fresh and exciting insights and experiences, this book makes the somewhat mysterious subject of poetry clear for those who read it and for those who write it -- and for those who would like to read it and write it better. Koch accomplishes this revelation of poetry by presenting the idea that poetry is a separate language, a language in which music and sound are as important as syntax or meaning. Thus he is able to clarify the many aspects of poetry: the nature of poetic inspiration, what happens when a poet is writing a poem, revision, and what actually goes on while one is reading a poem -- how confusion or only partial understanding eventually leads to truly experiencing a poem.The language of poetry, like other languages, can be learned by reading it and writing it. To assist the reader in learning the language of poetry, Koch provides a rich anthology of poems -- each accompanied by an explanatory note -- specially designed to complement and illuminate his text. There are lyric poems, excerpts from long poems and from poetic plays, poems in English and in translation. Among the poets whose work is included are Homer, Ovid, Sappho, Shakespeare, Byron, Dickinson, Baudelaire, Li Bel, Stevens, Williams, Lorca, Ashbery, and Snyder.In this book, Kenneth Koch&#39;s genius for making poetry clear and bringing out its real pleasures is everywhere apparent.</p><p>Ordinary mortals and poet scholars alike will find something to love in Koch's down-to-earth approach to making sense of that most head scratching of literary genres. Asserting that "poetry ... is a separate language," he steers clear of the stodgy, hidden-meaning school of deciphering poems (wherein the reader digs through the poem "for some elusive and momentous significance") and takes us instead on a tour through the tonal, rhythmical, and metrical aspects of poetry. Yes, it's about the music: "The sound of words is raised to an importance equal to that of their meaning, and also to the importance of grammar and syntax." But rather than asking us to simply take his word for it, Koch provides lively and insightful examples (including many rarely anthologized poems). For instance, why does "two and two are rather green" have little or no meaning, while "two and two / Are rather blue" smacks of the truth? Why does "I don't know whether or not to commit suicide" plop from the mouth like so much cold oatmeal, while "To be or not to be, that is the question" is so pleasing to the ears? Resonance, says Koch. "Poetry lasts because it gives the ambiguous and ever-changing pleasure of being both a statement and a song." <p> Moving from poetry's music to its methods (comparisons, personifications, and apostrophe, to name a few), Koch continues to offer up an amusing and edifying array of excerpts and analogies to clarify his point that with poetry, "as with baseball ... one has to understand a little in order to enjoy it...." Insightful, yet never patronizing, <i>Making Your Own Days</i> is for anyone who's ever read a poem and wished it were more "like a newspaper article." Though Koch can't tell us why Wallace Stevens wrote "I placed a jar in Tennessee," or why "So much depends / upon / a red wheel / barrow" (William Carlos Williams), he helps us listen to--and savor--that sometimes bewildering conglomeration of words otherwise known as poetry. <i>--Martha Silano</i></p>Kenneth Koch's most recent books of poetry -- <i>One Train</i> and <i>On the Great Atlantic Railway</i> (Selected Poems 1950-1988) -- both published in 1994, were awarded the Bollingen Prize for Poetry. Among his other books of poetry are <i>Thank You, The Pleasures of Peace, The Art of Love, On the Edge,</i> and <i>Seasons on Earth.</i> He has also published fiction and plays, as well as books on the teaching of poetry: <i>Wishes, Lies and Dreams; Rose, Where Did You Get That Red?;</i> and <i>I Never Told Anybody.</i> A new book of poems, <i>Straits,</i> will be published in the spring of 1998. Kenneth Koch lives in New York City, where he is professor of English at Columbia University.</p><h2>Art &amp; Ardor: Essays</h2><p>Among the pieces included in this collection of wide-ranging essays are two extended essays on Edith Wharton and Virginia Woolf and analyses of the work of contemporaries including Updike and Capote</p><p></p><h2>Town and Revolution: Soviet Architecture and City Planning, 1917-1935</h2><p>Anatole Kopp argues that the earliest socialist architecture stemmed not from European painting and sculpture but from revolutionary ideals. Neither prophets nor rebels against an established order, men like Melnikov, Leonidov, Ginzburg and the Vesnin brothers worked with their new state in seeking to change man by changing his environment. Despite internal strife, poor building materials, and technical difficulties, the twenties were years of experiments in a new way of life, both architecturally and socially. Students of history, politics, architecture, and urbanism will find Town and Revolution to be a unique source book as well as a pioneering history. The author supports his findings with 200 rare plans, views, and photographs, and with texts of articles, manifestos, and documents gathered in the Soviet Union and published here in English for the first time.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Cooking with Two Fat Ladies (Gastronomic Adventures with Motobike and sidecar)</h2><p>pp. 6 192.

Winter grips Wetmoreland and causes a rare phenonmenon: the lakes freeze. For two local families, the Richardsons and the Grindleys, this will bring unexpected upheaval, as the frozen lake entices long-estranged siblings and children to return home for the holiday season. Some are aware of what is happening in Europe; others don&#39;t want to know. Everyone&#39;s keen to put aside their troubles -- money worries, love tangles, career problems, domestic rifts -- and enjoy themselves skating while they can. But one visitor carries the seed of violence and not even the redoubtable matriarch of the Richardson clan can prevent the carefully buried secrets of the past from reappearing and transforming everything. A compelling blend of family closeness and strife, dazzling passion and the dark influence of history, this is an enthralling read to curl up and savour.</p><p>Elizabeth Edmondson has recently settled in Italy, having lived for many years in Dorset while she raised her family. Her grandparents once had a house on the lake shore in Westmoreland, and it was their stories and photographs which inspired her to write &#39;The Frozen Lake&#39;.</p><h2>Dictionary of symbols</h2><p>The author draws from the collective wisdom of the great psychologists, particularly Jung, to create a guide to the language of symbols. Just as we dream without being necessarily aware of our dreams, so our waking life is full of symbolism operating on an unconscious level. This book describes the major characteristics that recur in all symbolic material. By identifying them, readers may identify patterns and processes at work in their own minds, and in doing so learn to explore, develop and transform their psyches.</p><p>A handy reference on how to interpret symbols in dreams, myth, and everyday life.</p><h2>Cold Hit (Alexandra Cooper Mysteries)</h2><p>When the body of a wealthy art collector washes up on the north shore of Manhattan, a murder investigation ensues that will propel Assistant D.A. Alexandra cooper into the Chelsea art world, where art, politics, and old-fashioned avarice thrive in abundance. 150,000 first printing. Mystery Guild Main.</p><p>When Linda Fairstein describes the route Alexandra Cooper takes from the district attorney's office to NYPD headquarters, you know she's walked that way many times herself. "I took the shortcut over to One Police Plaza, cutting behind the Metropolitan Correctional Center and alongside the staggeringly expensive new federal courthouse, which made our digs, complete with oversized rodents and roaches that obviously thrived on Combat, look like judicial facilities in some third world country." <p> Like her fictional counterpart, Fairstein is a Manhattan assistant district attorney in charge of a sex-crimes unit. As she did in <i>Final Jeopardy</i> and <i>Likely to Die</i>, Fairstein mires her somewhat unlikely heroine (a beautiful 35-year-old blond with an Ivy League education, a house in Martha's Vineyard, and an affection for betting on quiz shows at cop bars) in a wealth of procedural detail. The "cold hit" of the title, for example, refers to a computer match between DNA samples from a recent rape case with evidence from an older crime. </p><p> With her trusty cop sidekicks Mike Chapman (who eats everything in sight and drops wisecracks like they're crumbs) and Mercer Wallace (who is a big fellow and can take a bullet meant for Alex without flinching), Cooper is working on two major cases--a serial rapist who has suddenly decided to come out of hiding and a couple of murders linked to the nasty underground world of fine-art sales. But she also has time to give her fellow sex-crime prosecutors advice on how to handle everything from a man shooting video up women's skirts at a <i>Star Trek</i> convention to a guy who takes his love for racehorses well past the legal limits. Once again, Fairstein has produced a story whose entertainment value is very high. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p><b>Linda Fairstein,</b> America's foremost prosecutor of crimes of sexual assault and domestic violence, has run the Sex Crimes Unit of the District Attorney's Office in Manhattan for more than two decades. A Fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers, she is a graduate of Vassar College and the University of Virginia School of Law. Her first novel, <i>Final Jeopardy,</i> which introduced the character Alexandra Cooper, was published in 1996 to critical and commercial acclaim, followed in 1997 by <i>Likely to Die,</i> which also achieved international bestseller status.

Clay: An American Life</h2><p>Chronicles the life of the distinguished statesman, covering his West Point days, his experiences in the army&#39;s Corps of Engineers, his directorship of military procurement under FDR, and his role as military governor of post-war Germany</p><p>This thoroughly researched and engaging book by college professor Jean Edward Smith opens the door to the life of Lucius D. Clay, a man referred to in some circles as a "logistical genius" and as "one of the most skillful politicians to wear the uniform of the United States Army." Smith illustrates how Clay selflessly devoted his life to public service, making him an influential and significant player in some of the most momentous events of the 20th century. As military governor from 1945 to 1949, Clay had a pivotal role in laying the foundation for the prosperous and democratic Germany of today. He also played a key role in initiating the New Deal policies of FDR as well as preparing America for the military mobilization required for World War II. In <i>Lucius D. Clay: An American Life</i>, Smith has compiled a wonderful and important biography, and thus offers a valuable service to any student of military and social history. <i>--Jeremy Storey</i>Clay (1898-1978) headed the military procurement effort in WW II, served as U.S. military governor in occupied Germany until his retirement from the Army in '49, and went on to careers in business and banking. He was also active in politics, playing a pivotal role in Eisenhower's '52 presidential campaign. Pragmatic, decisive and incorruptible, he was a type of American who, as Smith notes, "seems less in evidence as the century winds down." The biography is based in part on interviews Smith, editor of The Papers of General Lucius D. Clay , conducted with Clay over a six-year period. Of particular interest are the general's detailed comments on his tenure as military governor of Germany and commander of U.S. forces in Europe, when he laid the foundation for a prosperous and stable Federal Republic of Germany and stood firm against the Soviets with the 1948-1949 Berlin airlift. Short on humor, not given to self-revelation or illustrative anecdote, Clay as depicted here remains a remote and two-dimensional figure. But his mighty deeds are well chronicled in this meticulously researched biography.

Close personal friend and director of Bruce's greatest movie, Robert Clouse, reveals his first-hand memories of Bruce and includes interviews with Bruce's family, friends and colleagues in order to tell us the true story of how Bruce livedand died. Also included are numerous photos, many never before made available to the public.</p></p><p><p>Robert Clouse directed Bruce Lee's most famous film, Enter the Dragon. During the making of this film, he became close personal friends with Bruce.</p>My direct contact with Bruce Lee occurred between November 1972 and June 1973 when I started preproduction of the film Enter the Dragion and through the post-production period when Bruce came to the Warner Brothers Studio in Burbank, Calif., to complete some dubbig of dialogue that had been poorly recorded in Hong Kong. Many of the people I interviewed for this book I had known from that time, but many others I met for the first time during research of the elusive Bruce Lee. My perceptions of Bruce were dented and bent from what I knew about him; others were destroyed. Piecing together the portrait is imprecise, but the attempt goes on.</p><h2>The Failure of the Founding Fathers: Jefferson, Marshall, and the Rise of Presidential Democracy</h2><p><p> The ink was barely dry on the Constitution when it was almost destroyed by the rise of political parties in the United States. As Bruce Ackerman shows, the Framers had not anticipated the two-party system, and when Republicans battled Federalists for the presidency in 1800, the rules laid down by the Constitution exacerbated the crisis. With Republican militias preparing to march on Washington, the House of Representatives deadlocked between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr. Based on seven years of archival research, the book describes previously unknown aspects of the electoral college crisis. Ackerman shows how Thomas Jefferson counted his Federalist rivals out of the House runoff, and how the Federalists threatened to place John Marshall in the presidential chair. Nevertheless, the Constitution managed to survive through acts of statesmanship and luck. </p><p> Despite the intentions of the Framers, the presidency had become a plebiscitarian office. Thomas Jefferson gained office as the People's choice and acted vigorously to fulfill his popular mandate. This transformation of the presidency serves as the basis for a new look at Marbury v. Madison, the case that first asserted the Supreme Court's power of judicial review. Ackerman shows that Marbury is best seen in combination with another case, Stuart v. Laird, as part of a retreat by the Court in the face of the plebiscitarian presidency. This "switch in time" proved crucial to the Court's survival, allowing it to integrate Federalist and Republican themes into the living Constitution of the early republic. </p><p> Ackerman presents a revised understanding of the early days of two great institutions that continue to have a major impact on American history: the plebiscitarian presidency and a Supreme Court that struggles to put the presidency's claims of a popular mandate into constitutional perspective. </p></p><p>Bruce Ackerman is Sterling Professor of Law and Political Science at Yale University.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/ACKAME_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>Santa Barbara Architecture: From Spanish Colonial to Modern</h2><p>Santa Barbara occupies a unique place in the development of California. Perfect weather, moneyed residents, a pool of talented architects, a long ranching tradition, and some restrictive building codes combined to make Santa Barbara a treasure-trove of interesting buildings. The major style is, of course, the Spanish or Mediterranean, and this book probably does more than any other to document this rich tradition. This book is useful to both architectural buffs and to anyone who wants to see and utilize the rich architectural heritage that is Santa Barbara.</p><p></p><h2>Fallen Leaves: Last Words on Life, Love, War, and God</h2><p>Praised as a &#x201c;revelatory&#x201d; book by <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, this is the last and most personal work of Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author and historian Will Durant, discovered thirty-two years after his death.<br><br>The culmination of Will Durant&#x2019;s sixty-plus years spent researching the philosophies, religions, arts, sciences, and civilizations from across the world, <i>Fallen Leaves</i> is the distilled wisdom of one of the world&#x2019;s greatest minds, a man with a renowned talent for rendering the insights of the past accessible. Over the course of Durant&#x2019;s career he received numerous letters from &#x201c;curious readers who have challenged me to speak my mind on the timeless questions of human life and fate.&#x201d; With <i>Fallen Leaves</i>, his final book, he at last accepted their challenge.<br> <br>In twenty-two short chapters, Durant addresses everything from youth and old age to religion, morals, sex, war, politics, and art. <i>Fallen Leaves</i> is &#x201c;a thought-provoking array of opinions&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>), offering elegant prose, deep insights, and Durant&#x2019;s revealing conclusions about the perennial problems and greatest joys we face as a species. In Durant&#x2019;s singular voice, here is a message of insight for everyone who has ever sought meaning in life or the counsel of a learned friend while navigating life&#x2019;s journey.</p><p>Will Durant (1885&#x2013;1981) was awarded the Pulitzer Prize (1968) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1977). He spent more than fifty years writing his critically acclaimed eleven-volume series, <i>The Story of Civilization</i> (the later volumes written in conjunction with his wife, Ariel). A champion of human rights issues, such as the brotherhood of man and social reform, long before such issues were popular, Durant&#x2019;s writing still educates and entertains readers around the world.&nbsp;Fallen Leaves CHAPTER ONE<p></p> <br><br> OUR LIFE BEGINS<p></p> <br>A group of little children with their ways and chatter flow in,<br> <br>Like welcome rippling water o&#x2019;er my heated nerves and flesh.<br> <br>&#x2014;WALT WHITMAN, &#x201c;AFTER THE ARGUMENT&#x201d;<br> <br>We like children first of all because they are ours; prolongations of our luscious and unprecedented selves. However, we also like them because they are what we would but cannot be&#x2014;coordinated animals, whose simplicity and unity of action are spontaneous, whereas in the philosopher they come only after struggle and suppression. We like them because of what in us is called selfishness&#x2014;the naturalness and undisguised directness of their instincts. We like their unhypocritical candor; they do not smile to us when they long for our annihilation. Kinder und Narren sprechen die Wahrheit&#x2014;&#x201c;Children and fools speak the truth&#x201d;; and somehow they find happiness in their sincerity.<br> <br>See him, the newborn, dirty but marvelous, ridiculous in actuality, infinite in possibility, capable of that ultimate miracle&#x2014;growth. Can you conceive it&#x2014;that this queer bundle of sound and pain will come to know love, anxiety, prayer, suffering, creation, metaphysics, death? He cries; he has been so long asleep in the quiet warm womb of his mother; now suddenly he is compelled to breathe, and it hurts; compelled to see light, and it pierces him; compelled to hear noise, and it terrifies him. Cold strikes his skin, and he seems to be all pain. But it is not so; nature protects him against this initial onslaught of the world by dressing him in a general insensitivity. He sees the light only dimly; he hears the sounds as muffled and afar. For the most part he sleeps. His mother calls him a &#x201c;little monkey,&#x201d; and she is right; until he walks he will be like an ape, and even less of a biped, the womb-life having given his funny little legs the incalculable flexibility of a frog&#x2019;s. Not till he talks will he leave the ape behind, and begin to climb precariously to the stature of a human being.<br> <br>Watch him, and see how, bit by bit, he learns the nature of things by random movements of exploration. The world is a puzzle to him; and these haphazard responses of grasping, biting, and throwing are the pseudopodia, which he puts out to a perilous experience. Curiosity consumes and develops him; he would touch and taste everything from his rattle to the moon. For the rest he learns by imitation, though his parents think he learns by sermons. They teach him gentleness, and beat him; they teach him mildness of speech, and shout at him; they teach him a Stoic apathy to finance, and quarrel before him about the division of their income; they teach him honesty, and answer his most profound questions with lies. Our children bring us up by showing us, through imitation, what we really are.<br> <br>The child might be the beginning and the end of philosophy. In its insistent curiosity and growth lies the secret of all metaphysics; looking upon it in its cradle, or as it creeps across the floor, we see life not as an abstraction, but as a flowing reality that breaks through all our mechanical categories, all our physical formulas. Here in this expansive urgency, this patient effort and construction, this resolute rise from hands to feet, from helplessness to power, from infancy to maturity, from wonder to wisdom&#x2014;here is the &#x201c;Unknowable&#x201d; of Spencer, the Noumenon of Kant, the Ens Realissimum of the Scholastics, the &#x201c;Prime Mover&#x201d; of Aristotle, the To ontos on, or &#x201c;That Which Really Is,&#x201d; of Plato; here we are nearer to the basis of things than in the length and breadth and thickness and weight and solidity of matter, or in the cogs and pulleys and wheels and levers of a machine. Life is that which is discontent, which struggles and seeks, which suffers and creates. No mechanistic or materialistic philosophy can do it justice, or understand the silent growth and majesty of a tree, or compass the longing and laughter of children.<br> <br>Childhood may be defined as the age of play; therefore some children are never young, and some adults are never old.</p><h2>The New York Times: 36 Hours 125 Weekends in Europe</h2><p><strong>From Paris to Perm and beyond: Dream weekends with practical itineraries in all corners of Europe</strong> &nbsp; Culture, history, natural beauty, fine cuisine, artistic masterpieces, cutting-edge architecture and style&#x2014;<strong>Europe overflows with so many riches</strong> that a lifetime seems too short to appreciate them.

In Come Unto Me, volume 2 of the bestselling series The Kingdom and the Crown, Simeon of Capernaum wrestles with how to undo the damage wrought by his reluctant conversion to a man called Jesus of Nazareth. His determination to follow the teachings of the Master has cost the life of one friend and sent three others to a Roman prison to await execution. How can he stay true to the teachings of Jesus, which require that he love his enemies, and yet deliver the friends who face death because of him? A similar dilemma faces Miriam of Jerusalem. Her father, along with the other leaders of the powerful Sanhedrin, are determined to stamp out the growing popularity of this itinerant preacher from Nazareth. But Miriam too has found Jesus to be far more than a mere man, and this poses a terrible choice for her--will she follow family or faith? From the Galilee to Jerusalem to the great city of Rome, Come Unto Me continues the story of the people whose lives are forever changed by the teachings of a simple carpenter from Nazareth.

By the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning author of The Forever War.</p><p>Joe Haldeman is a Vietnam veteran whose classic novels <i>The Forever War</i> and <i>Forever Peace</i> both have the rare honor of winning the Hugo and Nebula Awards. He has served twice as president of the Science Fiction Writers of America and is currently an adjunct professor teaching writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.In 2019, a mysterious, egg-shaped artifact is discovered on the ocean floor off the coast of Samoa. Denser than any known material, the object defies all attempts to either break through or communicate with it. Marine biologist Russell Sutton, whose last major feat was raising the <i>Titanic</i>, takes charge of the excavation, hoping to make a fortune by capitalizing on the artifact's probable extraterrestrial origin. Sutton little suspects that his destiny will soon intertwine with a pair of shape-shifting--and apparently immortal--aliens. One, known as the changeling, has been on Earth millions of years, assuming every identity from shark to human being, and slowly learning to love. The other, called the chameleon, has excelled in warlike roles and delights in killing. Neither knows of the other's existence, but their slowly merging paths will meet in a stunning climax that determines their ultimate fates--and that of the artifact. Award-winning sf veteran Haldeman proves as engaging a storyteller as ever, especially given this book's irresistible premise and page-turning action. <i>Carl Hays</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

But his fear turns to confusion as he discovers he has been chosen to fill a vacancy on a special international commission investigating Tibetan suicides. Soon he finds that his predecessor was murdered, and when a monk sets himself on fire in front of the commissioners he realizes that the Commission is being used as a tool to whitewash Tibet's self-immolation protests as acts of crime and terrorism. Shan faces an impossible dilemma when the Public Security officer who runs the Commission, Major Ren, orders the imprisoned Lokesh beaten to coerce Shan into following Beijing's script for the Commission. He has no choice but to become part of the hated machine that is devouring Tibet, but when he discovers that the most recent immolation was actually another murder, he realizes the Commission itself is riddled with crime and intrigue. <br>Everywhere he turns, Shan finds new secrets that seem to lead to the last agonizing chapter of his life. Shan must make a final desperate effort to uncover the Commission's terrible secrets whose painful truth could change Shan's life - and possibly that of many Tibetans - forever.</p></p><p>ELIOT PATTISON is the Edgar Award-winning author of several previous Shan novels, including <i>The Skull Mantra.</i> A frequent visitor to China, his books and articles on international policy issues have been published around the world. He lives in Oley, Pennsylvania.<p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The tear on the young nun&#x2019;s cheek dripped onto the rosary in her hand. As she turned her brave, open face toward Shan Tao Yun, a shaft of sunlight burst through the port in the side of the prison wagon where they huddled, illuminating the tear like a diamond. Once, precious stones had been prized in their land for the adornment of altars and reliquaries. As Shan stared at the rosary, he realized that such tears were the new jewels of Tibet.</p> <p>&#x201c;Drapchi, Longtou, Chushur, Gutsa,&#x201d; the old Tibetan at Shan&#x2019;s side recited in a matter-of-fact tone.</p> <p>Shan recognized the names of the prisons his friend Lokesh recited not because of his years as a government investigator in Beijing but due to his own years as a prisoner in Tibet. They were being transported from Lhadrung County, home of Tibet&#x2019;s most infamous labor camps, toward the ring of prisons around Lhasa that were akin to medieval dungeons.</p> <p>&#x201c;We will have a hearing or trial or something, won&#x2019;t we?&#x201d; Yosen, the young nun, asked, then began patting the back of the second, older woman beside her. Pema, the grey-haired woman in the tattered felt dress of a farmer, had sat with her eyes closed for the last two hours, frantically working her prayer beads.</p> <p>&#x201c;There is supposed to be a chance to be heard,&#x201d; Shan agreed, putting more hope in his voice than he felt. Yosen was an innocent, unfamiliar with the ruthless ways of Beijing&#x2019;s Public Security Bureau.</p> <p>&#x201c;There will be blue papers with charges listed if they are expecting several years&#x2019; imprisonment,&#x201d; Lokesh explained in the tone of an expert. &#x201c;Yellow papers if it&#x2019;s only an administrative detention. Yellow means no more than a year,&#x201d; he added more brightly, but then cast a worried glance at Shan. The two friends could list a dozen possible charges against themselves, from sheltering political dissidents to destroying public property and concealing the Buddhist artifacts that Beijing insisted belonged to the state. Any one of those charges would send them back into the gulag for years.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yellow, then,&#x201d; Yosen bravely said, squeezing her companion&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;The gods will bring us yellow, Pema. We didn&#x2019;t do anything. Except speak of a dead friend.&#x201d;</p> <p>Shan leaned toward the young woman. Yosen had said the two women were not well acquainted, that she had been pulled out of a chapel at her convent after Pema was taken from a pilgrim&#x2019;s path nearby. The Public Security soldiers, the knobs, who arrested the women, had offered no explanation. &#x201c;A dead friend?&#x201d;</p> <p>Yosen nodded and looked up as the older woman bent lower over her beads. &#x201c;Before you joined us, Pema and I spoke. I asked her if she knew any reason for this&#x2014;&#x201d; She gestured around the rust-stained cell on wheels. &#x201c;Before they took us, they asked if we knew a woman named Sonam Gyari.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Did this Sonam commit a crime?&#x201d; Shan asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not a crime. A suicide,&#x201d; Yosen replied.</p> <p>Lokesh put a reassuring hand on the young nun&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;They can&#x2019;t imprison you for having a friend who died.&#x201d;</p> <p>Yosen shrugged. &#x201c;She was my closest friend in my convent. They came last week to check our records, wanted to know if she had signed her loyalty oath. Had she recently been home with family? Had she been visited by strangers? It was the same knobs who dragged me from my prayers today.&#x201d; Tears flowed down her cheeks again. &#x201c;I was supposed to fill the butter lamps on the altar. What if the lamps go dark?&#x201d;</p> <p>Lokesh gently pulled her head into his shoulder.</p> <p>Shan stood and braced himself on the steel wall to look out its small port. Since Shan and Lokesh were intercepted hours earlier at the ditch where they had been working, the wagon had been driving steadily west toward the Tibetan capital, pausing only at security checkpoints and for a brief rest stop at a truck station, where the rear door was cracked open enough for bottles of water and a bag of cold dumplings to be tossed inside.</p> <p>&#x201c;Six checkpoints,&#x201d; Lokesh said as they pulled away from yet another police barrier across the highway. &#x201c;Last time on this road, it was only three.&#x201d;</p> <p>The news seemed to increase Pema&#x2019;s foreboding. She groaned and dropped her head into her hands. The police were getting more nervous about the <i>purbas,</i> the Tibetan resistance, and quicker to forcefully respond to any hint of political protest. After two generations of Chinese occupation, Tibetans still refused to be broken.</p> <p>&#x201c;They came and demanded oaths of loyalty to Beijing last fall,&#x201d; the young nun said in a tight voice. &#x201c;I was away on retreat and sent mine in two weeks late. The party member who manages the convent chastised me, said such a delay could be taken as unpatriotic. I missed two lectures on the duties of citizens given by those Religious Affairs officers. I hear there are quotas now for arresting disloyal monks and nuns. If they decide to call me a traitor, I could be put away for ten or fifteen years.&#x201d; She too was considering her sins against the state. It was futile, Shan was tempted to tell her, for Beijing was constantly defining new sins for people like her. It hated anyone who even hinted that Tibetans were not Chinese, but most of all it despised those who wore the maroon robes, for it was the monks and nuns who kept the people rooted in Tibetan tradition.</p> <p>&#x201c;I visited your convent once,&#x201d; Lokesh suddenly declared to Yosen in a whimsical tone. &#x201c;It was 1956, and I traveled with the Dalai Lama, who was just a boy then. He was quite taken with the flock of white goats kept by the abbess.&#x201d;</p> <p>Both women looked up with round, wondering eyes, and for the next hour the old Tibetan drew them away from their despair with tales of the joyful oasis the convent had been before the Chinese occupation.</p> <p>Shan marveled at his friend&#x2019;s comforting words, spoken with no trace of the fear they both felt. They well knew the ways of Public Security, had suffered its wrath frequently, but had always been able to avoid new prison terms. Today their luck had run out, for they were being driven away from Lhadrung County and the protection of its governor, Colonel Tan. By nightfall, Shan would be listening to his charges, then pleading for a chance to send a note to his son, Ko, himself in a Lhadrung prison. Already he was forming the words of his letter in his mind: <i>I will find you, Ko. No matter where they send me I will find a way to return. Listen to the lamas.</i> Ko would know he meant listen to the lamas instead of the guards. That was how Shan had survived his own five years in the gulag.</p> <p>His companions were sleeping when the truck slowed for another checkpoint before entering what appeared to be a tunnel. Suddenly it stopped, reversed, and its engine died. The rear doors were unlocked and thrown open to reveal six knobs on a loading dock, leveling automatic rifles at them. An officer stepped forward and motioned Shan out. He ignored the officer and turned toward his companions, shaking each awake, calming the women as they saw the weapons.</p> <p>&#x201c;You will be processed first,&#x201d; he whispered in warning. &#x201c;Do not resist, do not argue, but do not admit to anything and do not sign anything.&#x201d; He did not have the heart to tell them how first their rosaries, then their traditional clothes would be torn from them, how they would be hosed down with frigid water, then stinging disinfectant before being separated and processed into work units. Pema hastily bent over her beads, then Yosen took her hand and led the older woman into the aisle formed by the guards, leading to another prison wagon. Lokesh seemed unaware of the knobs. He was staring in confusion at the place where the women had huddled. Pema hadn&#x2019;t been reciting one last desperate mantra; she had been sketching a pattern in water on the side of the truck.</p> <p>No religion on earth used more signs and symbols than Tibetan Buddhism, and Shan had learned many glyphs, but not this one. It was an oval with a crescent shape intersecting the upper right edge, bending forward. He stared so intently, struggling to understand the fading sign, that he did not realize two more knobs had entered the truck until they began leading Lokesh away.</p> <p>Without thinking, he reached out and grabbed the arm of the nearest guard and then, realizing what he had done, reflexively bent to receive the blow that would surely come. The soldier shook Shan off and laughed.</p> <p>He gazed in despair but also confusion as the knobs escorted Lokesh into the second truck, then he leapt forward and managed to get within several feet of his old friend before the knobs seized him. &#x201c;Loooo-kesh!&#x201d; he cried.</p> <p>His friend gazed back at Shan with impossible serenity. <i>&#x201c;Lha gyal lo,&#x201d;</i> the old man called back as the guards shoved him inside the truck. It was the mantra of battered Tibetans: <i>May the gods be victorious.</i></p> <p>Suddenly Shan was alone with the knobs. They did not present the expected manacles, did not produce the usual batons, only motioned him with bored expressions toward a metal door. They climbed a dank cinder block stairwell, exiting into a brightly lit hallway of offices beside a washroom. The officer opened the door and pointed to a row of pegs on the wall. &#x201c;Five minutes,&#x201d; he announced, then stepped back into the hall. They had a different punishment in mind for Shan.</p> <p>Shan stared at the door as it swung closed, then at the white shirt and grey slacks on the pegs. He knew from agonizing experience that Public Security was at its most treacherous when it did the unexpected. Something very disturbing was happening, something that hinted of a permanent shift in his life, which he desperately did not want. The few hardened criminals who served among the aging political prisoners of his gulag prison had told Shan that there was always a final run point, a place where a prisoner could still flee before the state&#x2019;s iron grip closed around him. Shan could still run, could lose himself in this strange office building. But he would never be able to help Lokesh by resisting or fleeing. He forced himself to step to the sink to wash off the stench of the meat wagon and began unbuttoning his shirt.</p> <p>A new escort awaited him in the corridor&#x2014;a short, lean man in his thirties with long, carefully groomed hair&#x2014;wearing a suit and tie. &#x201c;My name is Tuan Yangdong. I am here to assist you, Comrade Shan,&#x201d; he offered in an earnest tone, and gestured down the hall.</p> <p>Shan responded with only a nod.</p> <p>&#x201c;You must be excited to have this opportunity,&#x201d; Tuan offered as they walked.</p> <p>&#x201c;I would be excited to be back in my ditch in Lhadrung,&#x201d; Shan replied. Tuan looked at him uncertainly, shrugged, and remained silent as he led Shan to a corner conference room. It was midafternoon, and they were high enough above the ground for an unobstructed view of their surroundings. Shan quickly stepped to the row of windows and found himself overlooking a large compound of nearly identical grey buildings. As his escort poured tea from a large thermos, Shan looked back at the door. It had no locks.</p> <p>&#x201c;You have me confused with someone else,&#x201d; Tuan suggested as he extended a steaming cup to Shan.</p> <p>&#x201c;You mean a different Public Security Bureau?&#x201d; Shan asked. &#x201c;If you want to help, then tell me where my friend is going.&#x201d;</p> <p>Tuan shrugged again. &#x201c;I am just with the Religious Affairs.&#x201d;</p> <p>Shan hesitated. The Bureau of Religious Affairs was the agency that strictly, often ruthlessly, regulated the practice of Buddhism in Tibet. &#x201c;Half those working for Religious Affairs are seconded from Public Security. Does that include you, Comrade Tuan?&#x201d;</p> <p>The question caught Tuan off guard. &#x201c;Not exactly,&#x201d; he said awkwardly. &#x201c;Not anymore. The Party says we must consider Public Security like a college,&#x201d; he offered with surprising candor. &#x201c;Religious Affairs officers are encouraged to spend two or three years with Public Security to better understand the challenges the motherland faces in Tibet.&#x201d; A small, tentative smile appeared on his face. &#x201c;You seem well versed in the ways of the government for one brought in from such a remote county as Lhadrung.&#x201d;</p> <p>When Shan gave no reply, Tuan sighed and busied himself straightening a stack of tablets on a side table. Shan turned back to the windows. They were in a town that was dominated by a dozen four-story glass and concrete buildings and surrounded by a high wall of painted cinder blocks. It was one of the self-contained enclaves for government workers that were being erected all over Tibet, cornerstones for Beijing&#x2019;s expanding structure in the region. Inside the walls would be command centers, offices, apartments, and even shops and caf�s for the bureaucrats shipped in from the east.</p> <p>&#x201c;Welcome to Zhongje,&#x201d; Tuan said over his shoulder. &#x201c;A model town, a settlement of the new age designed to meet all the needs of its residents. Just rocks and grazing sheep three years ago, and now look&#x2014;a showcase for the motherland!&#x201d; He pointed out the small square planted with spindly trees that was the town park, an electrical substation, a constable post by the gate, a compound of garages with street maintenance equipment, even a town incinerator. &#x201c;A taste of what waits all loyal Tibetans.&#x201d;</p> <p>Shan stepped to the windows facing north, pulled back the drapes that obscured them, and froze. On the adjacent slope, less than a mile away, there was another, much larger walled compound.</p> <p>Suddenly Shan knew where he was. Sangpu Abbey had once been the home of one of the largest Buddhist colleges in Tibet, where scores of lamas trained thousands of novices for the spiritual life. But in the early years of the Chinese occupation, it was converted into the largest prison in Tibet and renamed Longtou, Chinese for Head of the Dragon. Its meditation chambers had been stripped to bare stone and used for solitary confinement, its chapels transformed into squalid cell blocks. Shan himself had spent several days behind its bars before being assigned to his death camp in Lhadrung County. His gaze fell on the long, low mounds that cascaded down the slope below the prison. A casual observer might dismiss them as old bunkers or terraces, but Shan had been assigned to a work crew clearing a path for a new road being cut through the mounds. When Beijing had begun crushing the Tibetan Buddhist establishment, Sangpu was one of its starting places. Shan had worked with a horse cart, gathering bones from an exposed mound for shipment to a fertilizer factory. The monks of the abbey had been lined up by the open pits and mown down with machine guns. He recalled now the positioning of the mounds and with a shudder, realized that those near the bottom of the slope had been leveled for construction of the Chinese town. Zhongje, it was called, meaning Peace and Justice.</p> <p>The tap of a spoon on a porcelain cup broke the silence. Shan turned to discover a Tibetan man and two Chinese women seated at the table, staring at him. Tuan sat along the wall beside a sinewy, balding man in a knob officer&#x2019;s uniform who was lighting a cigarette. A row of overhead lights had been switched on, casting circles of harsh light on the table. Here at last was his interrogation team.</p> <p>A file folder had been placed before the chair in front of Shan. He dutifully sat, sensing now the familiar ground. Inside would be a list of his crimes and a confession ready for his signature.</p> <p>&#x201c;I am Commissioner Choi,&#x201d; the elder of the two women announced in a stern voice. &#x201c;You are Comrade Shan Tao Yun of Beijing and Lhadrung County.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Just Lhadrung County,&#x201d; he replied in a flat voice. &#x201c;Beijing was another life.&#x201d; The woman who spoke, in her late forties with her hair tightly tied at the nape, had the air of an austere professor, the younger woman at her side that of an attentive student.

There's also the value of being concise in all communication, which confining one's input to one-minute chunks certainly facilitates. The lessons are both simple and profound, and are crafted and expressed with as much elegance as any management advice I've heard in the years since they first appeared.

She lives in Buffalo, NY.<b><p>Chapter One</p><p>Rainy Night</p></b><p>It all began one rainy night at the end of a summer.</p><p>"As if we didn't have enough troubles!" groaned Mrs. Chipley. "There it goes and rains on us!"</p><p>Sally, clinging to Mrs. Chipley's plump hand, was almost running to keep up with her. The bright feather on Mrs. Chipley's black hat, which had started out so proudly erect, had gradually wilted, and now drooped sadly down the back of that lady's stout neck. Sally's red SUitcase, its handle firmly gripped by Mrs. Chipley's other hand, bumped in a steady rhythm against her right leg. But Mrs. Chipley strode purposefully on, as if she had no time to notice small discomforts.</p><p>The two of them had come all the way across the city on the bus, and during the ride the sky had darkened and the streetlights had bloomed all at once. High-piling storm clouds snuffed out the light of the round orange moon. As they stepped off the bits, the branches of the tall trees rattled like bones in the wind.</p><p>And now it was raining--a nasty, cold, stinging rain, mixed with wet leaves torn from the groaning trees. It splashed and flew about them as they hurried along the gloomy street, as if the faster they went the more they stirred up the fury of the night. Their coattails snapped behind them. Rain flew into Sally's eyes and even into her mouth, and it dribbled unpleasantly beneath the collar of her coat. Raindrops hitting a large mailbox echoed like drumbeats</p><p>down the street. Sally's long red hair, fluttering bannerlike behind her, gave their small processiona brave look. And yet, Sally, at least, was not feeling brave at all. Quite the contrary.</p><p>"Troubles, troubles," Mrs. Chipley went on, "but it's a lucky thing your Aunt Sarah's come back to town just now when we need her."</p><p>"I don't remember her at all," panted Sally. "I was just a baby when she went away to California."</p><p>"Going back again, too, pretty soon, your ma tells me," said Mrs. Chipley. "Only came back here to sell the house. But never you mind, honey," she went on, without slackening her furious pace at all, "she's your own kin, and the only one you have here in town. I'm sure I didn't know what else to do but call her, what with your mom and dad away on that business trip, and we don't want to spoil it for them, andit's not as if you'd have to stay with your aunt forever. A few days and I'll have my daughter straightened around and come back. And it was your own ma left her name in case of an emergency."</p><p>"I wonder what she's like," Sally said. But Mrs. Chipley did not seem to hear her.</p><p>"And if my daughter's getting sick like that and five kids to take care of and her poor husband working day and night to keep food in their mouths isn't an emergency, then I'm sure I don't know what is!" Mrs. Chipley stopped so suddenly that Sally bumped into her. Mrs. Chipley, who was not very much taller than Sally herself, though a good deal bigger around, placed a steadying arm about Sally's shoulders and then peered up through the blowing rain at a street sign. She shook her head, sighed, and placed the red suitcase on the sidewalk.</p><p>"Land sakes, my glasses are all fogged over with wet," she said. "Can you read that sign, honey?"</p><p>Sally shaded her eyes and stood up on tiptoe, squinting to make out the letters on the sign in the uncertain gleam of a streetlight. The blowing shadows of tree branches came and went over the words on the sign. The letters wavered, grew taller, then shorter, then seemed to disappear entirely."It says Forest Road," she said at last.</p><p>"Can't hear you, dearie, your voice is gone all husky. Hope you don't go getting a cold now on top of everything else."</p><p>"Forest Road," said Sally, more strongly this time.</p><p>"This is it," said Mrs. Chipley, nodding vigorously. "Forest Road. Come along, honey." And picking up the suitcase, she led the way down Aunt Sarah's street. Sally's hand crept back into hers. "Now watch the numbers on the houses," Mrs. Chipley said. "It's eighty-two we want. Your young eyes are better than mine."</p><p>"But there aren't any houses," said Sally, for as far as she could see, all down the street on either side, were buildings, tall buildings, the light from their windows streaming out into the blowing street. Like the letters on the street sign, the buildings seemed to waver behind the lashing curtains of rain. A leaf danced in one of the streams of light for a moment, and then vanished into the darkness.</p><p>"It's a funny sort of street for your aunt to live on, all right," said Mrs. Chipley. "All these apartment buildings. But if it's Forest Road, it's got to be your aunt Sarah's street. You sure you read that sign right, honey?"</p><p>"Yes," said Sally. The hand clinging to Mrs. Chipley's grew suddenly very cold. Mrs. Chipley</p><p>looked down as if she'd noticed it too. She squeezed Sally's hand gently. "There, honey," she said, "you're not scared, are you?"</p><p>Sally shook her head. But she was scared. She was scared of the strange dark street with the rain splashing in the gutters, of the windblown shadows shivering over the walk, of the tall buildings looming over them and seeming to watch them with the glittering eyes of their windows. And of her aunt, whose street this was, and whom she did not know at all. </p></p><h2>Germany&#39;s Black Holocaust, 1890-1945: The Untold Truth!</h2><p>In the 1890s Blacks were tortured in German concentration camps in Southwest Africa (now called Namibia) when Adolph Hitler was only a child. Colonial German doctors conducted unspeakable medical experiments on these emaciated helpless Africans decades before such atrocities were ever visited upon the Jews. <p>Thousands of Africans were massacred. Regrettably, historians neglected to properly register the slaughter&#x2014;that is, to lift it from the footnote in history that it had been relegated to&#x2014;until now. </p><p>In an attempt to give the incidents their rightful recognition in the historical context of the Holocaust, Dr. Firpo W. Carr has authored a new book entitled, Germany&#x2019;s Black Holocaust: 1890&#x2013;1945. In it, he reveals the startling hidden history of Black victims of the Holocaust. The mayhem and carnage date back to the turn of the 20th century, many years before there were ever any other unfortunate victims&#x2014;Jew or Gentile&#x2014;of the Holocaust. </p><p>Carr conducted three incredibly revealing interviews with: (1) a Black female Holocaust victim; (2) the Black commanding officer who liberated 8,000 Black men from a concentration camp; and (3) an African American medic from the all-Black medical unit that was responsible for retrieving thousands of dead bodies from Dachau. (White medical units were spared the gruesome task.) </p><p>"Kay," the Black female Holocaust survivor, laments: "You cannot possibly comprehend the anger I have in me because of being experimented on in Dachau, and being called &#x2018;nigger girl&#x2019; and &#x2018;blacky&#x2019; while growing up." </p><p>Testimonials from the Black commanding officer and African American medic are memorialized, for the first time ever, in Carr&#x2019;s book. The research is based on voluminous documentation, and more. </p><p>If you are like most people, you simply have never heard the unbelievable story of Black victims of the Holocaust. You are invited to read about the human spirit's triump over events that occurred during this horrible piece of hidden history.</p></p><p>The author's research is based on voluminous documentation, and more. Aside from traveling to Israel to tour the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial back in 1987, Carr spent days digging through the archives at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C. where he uncovered invaluable information in the form of long-forgotten World War II newspaper articles from Nazi Germany, and other astounding documents that form a part of his book. <p>He has had temporary stints in Europe, traveling there twice, in studying the Holocaust. Although he visited France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria and Italy (all occupied by Nazi German troops at one time), he spent the most time in Germany itself. </p><p>Closer to home, Carr visited, on more than one occasion, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and the Museum of Tolerance, both in Los Angeles. He consulted with the head researcher at the former who obliged Carr by making rare documents available to him. </p><p>The author, who has taught at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), Mount Saint Mary&#x2019;s College in Brentwood, and who is currently teaching at the University of Phoenix, has studied the Holocaust for nearly 30 years, but has just recently focused on the untold story of the Black element of the Holocaust. Prior to the fall of the Iron Curtain, the Soviet Union honored him as a guest by allowing him to study, photograph, and eventually digitize ancient Hebrew manuscripts at the Russian National Library in St. Petersburg. </p><p>In the September/October 1992 issue of the prestigious magazine, Biblical Archaeology Review, editor Herschel Shanks wrote that Carr "in 1989 was the first foreigner to gain access to and photograph a number of items from the collection in the Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) state library. At the time Carr photographed, in color, the carpet page from the Leningrad Codex [a medieval Biblical manuscript written in Hebrew]... providing such photographs to the West." </p><p>He traveled to South America and Central America intending to find out all he could on Nazi war criminals who may still be living there. He visited Guatemala twice in Central America, however, he got only as far as Guyana in South America. </p><p>In his extensive travels, he also spent 3 weeks (1987) in the predominantly Black South American country of Guyana. While there, he participated in an international effort to help heal the gaping wound that the country experienced in the aftermath of the Jim Jones tragedy when the mass murder-suicide of 912 mostly Black Americans was committed. Carr has also authored 6 other books on religious and social issues. One of these, "Wicked Words: Poisoned Minds&#x2014;Racism in the Dictionary" (1997; also available through Amazon.com), served as the basis of a lecture he gave while in Cuba in April 2001. He read and studied each entry of Webster&#x2019;s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary in an effort to broaden his horizons. </p><p>It was unsettling for him to find racially charged definitions, particularly targeting Blacks, from A to Z. His findings, and other related matter, interested the Cuban government so much so that Fidel Castro authorized the 45-minute talk Carr delivered to be broadcast nationally. While visiting the communist island, Carr frequented the country&#x2019;s oldest synagogue, located in the capital, Havana. </p><p>His latest book on the Holocaust has 30 rare photographs and illustrations covering the period of time from the 1890s to the 1960s. Many of these photographs and illustrations have never before been published in the United States, or seen by the public.</p>"A very interesting book that's long overdue! It's bound to capture the interest of the public." -- <i>Kathy Williamson, Report for the Los Angeles Sentinel, the leading Black newspaper in the West.</i></p><h2>Ultimate X-Men Vol. 8: New Mutants (Ultimate X-men, 8)</h2><p>Collecting Ultimate X-Men #40-45.</p><p></p><h2>My Invented Country: A Nostalgic Journey Through Chile</h2><p><p>Isabel Allende's first memory of Chile is of a house she never knew. The "large old house" on the Calle Cueto, where her mother was born and which her grandfather evoked so frequently that Isabel felt as if she had lived there, became the protagonist of her first novel, <em>The House of the Spirits</em>. It appears again at the beginning of Allende's playful, seductively compelling memoir <em>My Invented Country</em>, and leads us into this gifted writer's world.</p> <p>Here are the almost mythic figures of a Chilean family -- grandparents and great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, and friends -- with whom readers of Allende's fiction will feel immediately at home. And here, too, is an unforgettable portrait of a charming, idiosyncratic Chilean people with a violent history and an indomitable spirit. Although she claims to have been an outsider in her native land -- "I never fit in anywhere, not into my family, my social class, or the religion fate bestowed on me" -- Isabel Allende carries with her even today the mark of the politics, myth, and magic of her homeland. In <em>My Invented County</em>, she explores the role of memory and nostalgia in shaping her life, her books, and that most intimate connection to her place of origin.</p><p>Two life-altering events inflect the peripatetic narration of this book: The military coup and violent death of her uncle, Salvador Allende Gossens, on September 11, 1973, sent her into exile and transformed her into a writer. The terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, on her newly adopted homeland, the United States, brought forth from Allende an overdue acknowledgment that she had indeed left home. <em>My Invented Country</em>, whose structure mimics the workings of memory itself, ranges back and forth across that distance accrued between the author's past and present lives. It speaks compellingly to immigrants, and to all of us, who try to retain a coherent inner life in a world full of contradictions.</p></p><p>"Nostalgia is my vice," admits Isabel Allende in <i>My Invented Country</i>. A question about nostalgia propels an exploration of her past, including the complicated history and politics of Chile, where she spent the better part of her childhood. Despite her strong connection to Chile, Allende says she has "been an outsider nearly all my life." Her stepfather was a diplomat, so her family moved quite frequently. In her travel diary, Allende compares everything to Chile, her "one eternal reference" point. <p> </p><p> "From saying goodbye so often my roots have dried up," she notes. She successfully reclaims them, however, through two channels. Allende relays anecdotes about what she calls her untraditional family--whom she has based some of her novels upon, including <i>The House of the Spirits</i>. Like a few of her novels, though, her own story is lost in heavy policy analysis. Interspersed among her ancestors' tales is an all-too-exhaustive report of Chile: the terrain, its people, customs, language, its heroes and villains, and the government. </p><p> </p><p> Allende fled Chile after the military coup on September 11, 1973. Twenty-eight years later, and now living in the United States, this date haunts her when terrorists attack New York City and Washington, D.C. Allende admits that the place she is homesick for may have never existed. In spite of that, Allende asserts that she can live and write anywhere: "I don&#x2019;t belong to one land, but to several, or perhaps only to the ambit of the fiction I write." The irony is that she steadfastly has "one foot in Chile and another here." <i>--C.J. Carrillo</i></p><p>Isabel Allende is the author of twelve works of fiction, including the <em>New York Times </em>bestsellers <em>Maya&#x2019;s Notebook, Island Beneath the Sea, In�s of My Soul, Daughter of Fortune</em>, and a novel that has become a world-renowned classic, T<em>he House of the Spirits</em>. Born in Peru and raised in Chile, she lives in California.</p></p><h2>Definitely Dead (Southern Vampire Mysteries, Book 6)</h2><p><br> As a person with so few living relatives, Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse really hated to lose one.

Brad Pitt,&#x201d; I whispered. The dark brown eyes still regarded me with remote interest.</p> <p>Okay, I was on the wrong track.</p> <p>I pictured Claude&#x2019;s last lover, a bouncer at a strip joint.</p> <p>&#x201c;Think about Charles Bronson,&#x201d; I suggested. &#x201c;Or, um, Edward James Olmos.&#x201d; I was rewarded by the beginnings of a hot glow in those long-lashed eyes.</p> <p>In a jiffy, you would&#x2019;ve thought Claude was going to hike up my long rustling skirt and yank down my low-cut push-up bodice and ravish me until I begged for mercy. Unfortunately for me -- and all the other women of Louisiana -- Claude batted for another team. Bosomy and blond was not Claude&#x2019;s ideal; tough, rough, and brooding, with maybe a little whisker stubble, was what lit his fire.</p> <p>&#x201c;Maria-Star, reach in there and pull that lock of hair back,&#x201d; Alfred Cumberland directed from behind the camera. The photographer was a heavyset black man with graying hair and mustache. Maria-Star Cooper took a quick step in front of the camera to rearrange a stray strand of my long blond hair. I was bent backward over Claude&#x2019;s right arm, my invisible (to the camera, anyway) left hand desperately clutching the back of his black frock coat, my right arm raised to rest gently on his left shoulder. His left hand was at my waist. I think the pose was meant to suggest that he was lowering me to the ground to have his way with me.</p> <p>Claude was wearing the black frock coat with black knee pants, white hose, and a white frothy shirt. I was wearing a long blue dress with a billowing skirt and a score of petticoats. As I&#x2019;ve mentioned, the dress was scanty on the topside, with the little sleeves pushed down off my shoulders. I was glad the temperature in the studio was moderately warm. The big light (it looked to my eyes like a satellite dish) was not as hot as I&#x2019;d expected.</p> <p>Al Cumberland was snapping away as Claude smoldered down at me. I did my best to smolder right back. My personal life had been, shall we say, barren for the past few weeks, so I was all too ready to smolder. In fact, I was ready to burst into flames.</p> <p>Maria-Star, who had beautiful light-toast skin and curly dark hair, was standing ready with a big makeup case and brushes and combs to perform last-minute repairs. When Claude and I had arrived at the studio, I&#x2019;d been surprised to find that I recognized the photographer&#x2019;s young assistant. I hadn&#x2019;t seen Maria-Star since the Shreveport packleader had been chosen a few weeks before. I hadn&#x2019;t had much of a chance to observe her then, since the packmaster contest had been frightening and bloody. Today, I had the leisure to see that Maria-Star had completely recovered from being hit by a car this past January. Werewolves healed quickly.</p> <p>Maria-Star had recognized me, too, and I&#x2019;d been relieved when she smiled back at me. My standing with the Shreveport pack was, to say the least, uncertain. Without exactly volunteering to do so, I&#x2019;d unwittingly thrown in my lot with the unsuccessful contestant for the packleader&#x2019;s job. That contestant&#x2019;s son, Alcide Herveaux, whom I&#x2019;d counted as maybe more than a friend, felt I&#x2019;d let him down during the contest; the new packleader, Patrick Furnan, knew I had ties to the Herveaux family. I&#x2019;d been surprised when Maria-Star chatted away while she was zipping the costume and brushing my hair. She applied more makeup than I&#x2019;d ever worn in my life, but when I stared into the mirror I had to thank her. I looked great, though I didn&#x2019;t look like Sookie Stackhouse.</p> <p>If Claude hadn&#x2019;t been gay, he might have been impressed, too. He&#x2019;s the brother of my friend Claudine, and he makes his living stripping on ladies&#x2019; night at Hooligans, a club he now owns. Claude is simply mouthwatering; six feet tall, with rippling black hair and large brown eyes, a perfect nose, and lips just full enough. He keeps his hair long to cover up his ears: they&#x2019;ve been surgically altered to look rounded like human ears, not pointed as they originally were. If you&#x2019;re in the know supernaturally, you&#x2019;ll spot the ear surgery, and you&#x2019;ll know Claude is a fairy. I&#x2019;m not using the pejorative term for his sexual orientation. I mean it literally; Claude&#x2019;s a fairy.</p> <p>&#x201c;Now the wind machine,&#x201d; Al instructed Maria-Star, and after a little repositioning, she switched on a large fan. Now we appeared to be standing in a gale. My hair billowed out in a blond sheet, though Claude&#x2019;s tied-back ponytail stayed in place. After a few shots to capture that look, Maria-Star unbound Claude&#x2019;s hair and directed it over one shoulder, so it would blow forward to form a backdrop for his perfect profile.</p> <p>&#x201c;Wonderful,&#x201d; Al said, and snapped some more. Maria-Star moved the machine a couple of times, causing the windstorm to strike from different directions. Eventually Al told me I could stand up. I straightened gratefully.</p> <p>&#x201c;I hope that wasn&#x2019;t too hard on your arm,&#x201d; I told Claude, who was looking cool and calm again.</p> <p>&#x201c;Nah, no problem. You have any fruit juice around?&#x201d; he asked Maria-Star. Claude was not Mr. Social Skills.</p> <p>The pretty Were pointed to a little refrigerator in the corner of the studio. &#x201c;Cups are on the top,&#x201d; she told Claude. She followed him with her eyes, and sighed. Women frequently did that after they&#x2019;d actually talked to Claude. The sigh was a &#x201c;what a pity&#x201d; sigh.</p> <p>After checking to make sure her boss was still fiddling intently with his gear, Maria-Star gave me a bright smile. Even though she was a Were, which made her thoughts hard to read, I was picking up on the fact that she had something she wanted to tell me . . . and she wasn&#x2019;t sure how I was going to take it.</p> <p>Telepathy is no fun. Your opinion of yourself suffers when you know what others think of you. And telepathy makes it almost impossible to date regular guys. Just think about it. (And remember, I&#x2019;ll know&#x2014;if you are, or if you aren&#x2019;t.)</p> <p>&#x201c;Alcide&#x2019;s had a hard time of it since his dad was defeated,&#x201d; Maria-Star said, keeping her voice low. Claude was occupied with studying himself in a mirror while he drank his juice. Al Cumberland had gotten a call on his cell phone and retreated to his office to hold his conversation.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure he has,&#x201d; I said. Since Jackson Herveaux&#x2019;s opponent had killed him, it was only to be expected that Jackson&#x2019;s son was having his ups and his downs. &#x201c;I sent a memorial to the ASPCA, and I know they&#x2019;ll notify Alcide and Janet,&#x201d; I said. (Janet was Alcide&#x2019;s younger sister, which made her a non-Were. I wondered how Alcide had explained their father&#x2019;s death to his sister.) In acknowledgement, I&#x2019;d received a printed thank-you note, the kind the funeral home gives you, without one personal word written on it.</p> <p>&#x201c;Well . . .&#x201d; She seemed to be unable to spit it out, whatever was stuck in her throat. I was getting a glimpse of the shape of it. Pain flickered through me like a knife, and then I locked it down and pulled my pride around me. I&#x2019;d learned to do that all too early in life.</p> <p>I picked an album of samples of Alfred&#x2019;s work and began to flip through them, hardly looking at the photographs of brides and grooms, bar mitzvahs, first communions, twenty-fifth wedding anniversaries. I closed that album and laid it down. I was trying to look casual, but I don&#x2019;t think it worked.</p> <p>With a bright smile that echoed Maria-Star&#x2019;s own expression, I said, &#x201c;Alcide and I weren&#x2019;t ever truly a couple, you know.&#x201d; I might have had longings and hopes, but they&#x2019;d never had a chance to ripen. The timing had always been wrong.</p> <p>Maria-Star&#x2019;s eyes, a much lighter brown than Claude&#x2019;s, widened in awe. Or was it fear? &#x201c;I heard you could do that,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s hard to believe.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I said wearily. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m glad you and Alcide are dating, and I have no right to mind, even if I did. Which I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; That came out kind of garbled (and it wasn&#x2019;t entirely true), but I think Maria-Star got my intention: to save my face.</p> <p>When I hadn&#x2019;t heard from Alcide in the weeks following his father&#x2019;s death, I&#x2019;d known that whatever feelings he&#x2019;d had for me were quenched. That had been a blow, but not a fatal one. Realistically, I hadn&#x2019;t expected anything more from Alcide. But gosh darn it, I liked him, and it always smarts when you find out you&#x2019;ve been replaced with apparent ease. After all, before his dad&#x2019;s death Alcide had suggested we live together. Now he was shacking up with this young Were, maybe planning to have puppies with her.</p> <p>I stopped that line of thought in its tracks. Shame on me! No point in being a bitch. (Which, come to think of it, Maria-Star actually was, at least three nights a month.)</p> <p>Double shame on me.</p> <p>&#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re very happy,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>She wordlessly handed me another album, this one stamped, Eyes Only. When I opened it, I realized that the Eyes were supernatural. Here were pictures of ceremonies humans never got to see . . . a vampire couple dressed in elaborate costume, posed before a giant ankh; a young man in the middle of changing into a bear, presumably for the first time; a shot of a Were pack with all its members in wolf form. Al Cumberland, photographer of the weird. No wonder he had been Claude&#x2019;s first choice for his pictures, which Claude hoped would launch him on a cover-model career.</p> <p>&#x201c;Next shot,&#x201d; called Al, as he bustled out of his office, snapping his phone shut. &#x201c;Maria-Star, we just got booked for a double wedding in Miss Stackhouse&#x2019;s neck of the woods.&#x201d; I wondered if he&#x2019;d been engaged for regular human work or for a supernatural event, but it would be rude to ask.</p> <p>Claude and I got up close and personal again. Following Al&#x2019;s instructions, I pulled up the skirt to display my legs. In the era my dress represented, I didn&#x2019;t think women tanned or shaved their legs, and I was brown and smooth as a baby&#x2019;s bottom. But what the hey. Guys didn&#x2019;t walk around with their shirts unbuttoned, either, at least in my experience.</p> <p>&#x201c;Raise your leg like you&#x2019;re going to wrap it around him,&#x201d; Alfred directed. &#x201c;Now Claude, this is your chance to shine. Look like you&#x2019;re going to pull your pants off at any second. We want the readers to pant when they look at you!&#x201d;</p> <p>Claude&#x2019;s portfolio of shots would be used when he entered the Mr. Romance competition, orchestrated each year by Romantic Times magazine.</p> <p>When he&#x2019;d shared his ambition with Al (I gathered they&#x2019;d met at a party), Al had advised Claude to have some pictures made with the sort of woman that often appeared on the cover of romance novels; he&#x2019;d told the fairy that Claude&#x2019;s dark looks would be set off by a blue-eyed blonde. I happened to be the only bosomy blonde of Claude&#x2019;s acquaintance who was willing to help him for free. Of course, Claude knew some strippers who would have done it, but they expected to be paid. With his usual tact, Claude had told me this on our way to the photographer&#x2019;s studio. Claude could have kept these details to himself, which would left me feeling good about helping out my friend&#x2019;s brother -- but in typical Claude fashion, he shared.</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay, Claude, now off with the shirt,&#x201d; Alfred called.</p> <p>Claude was used to being asked to take off his clothes. He had a broad, hairless, chest with impressive musculature, so he looked very nice indeed without his shirt. I was unmoved. Maybe I was becoming immune.</p> <p>&#x201c;Skirt, leg,&#x201d; Alfred reminded me, and I told myself that this was a job. Al and Maria-Star were certainly professional and impersonal, and you couldn&#x2019;t get cooler than Claude. But I wasn&#x2019;t used to pulling my skirt up in front of people, and it felt pretty personal to me. Though I showed this much leg when I wore shorts and never raised a blush, somehow the pulling up of the long skirt was a little more loaded with sexuality. I clenched my teeth and hiked up the material, tucking it at intervals so it would stay in position.</p> <p>&#x201c;Miss Stackhouse, you have to look like you&#x2019;re enjoying this,&#x201d; Al said. He peered at me from around his camera, his forehead creased in a definitely unhappy way.</p> <p>I tried not to sulk. I&#x2019;d told Claude I&#x2019;d do him a favor, and favors should be done willingly. I raised my leg so my thigh was parallel with the floor, and pointed my bare toes to the floor in what I hoped was a graceful position. I put both hands on Claude&#x2019;s naked shoulders and looked up at him. His skin felt warm and smooth to the touch -- not erotic or arousing.</p> <p>&#x201c;You look bored, Miss Stackhouse,&#x201d; Alfred said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re supposed to look like you want to jump his bones. Maria-Star, make her look more . . . more.&#x201d; Maria darted over to push the little puff sleeves farther down my arms. She got a little too enthusiastic, and I was glad the bodice was tight.</p> <p>The fact of the matter was, Claude could look beautiful and bare all day long, and I still wouldn&#x2019;t want him. He was grumpy and he had bad manners. Even if he&#x2019;d been hetero, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been my cup of tea&#x2014;after I&#x2019;d had ten minutes&#x2019; conversation with him.</p> <p>Like Claude earlier, I&#x2019;d have to resort to fantasy.</p> <p>I thought of Bill the vampire, my first love in every way. But instead of lust, I felt anger. Bill was dating another woman, had been for a few weeks.</p> <p>Okay, what about Eric, Bill&#x2019;s boss, the former Viking? Eric the vampire had shared my house and my bed for a few days in January. Nope, that way lay danger. Eric knew a secret I wanted to keep hidden for the rest of my days; though, since he&#x2019;d had amnesia when he&#x2019;d stayed at my place, he wasn&#x2019;t aware it was in his memory somewhere.</p> <p>A few other faces popped into my mind &#x2013; my boss, Sam Merlotte, the owner of Merlotte&#x2019;s Bar. No, don&#x2019;t go there, thinking about your boss naked is bad. Okay, Alcide Herveaux? Nope, that was a no-go, especially since I was in the company of his current girlfriend . . . Okay, I was clean out of fantasy material and would have to fall back on one of my old fictional favorites.</p> <p>But movie stars seemed bland after the supernatural world I&#x2019;d inhabited since Bill came into Merlotte&#x2019;s. The last remotely erotic experience I&#x2019;d had, oddly enough, had involved my bleeding leg getting licked. That had been . . . unsettling. But even under the circumstances, it had made things deep inside me twitch. I remembered how Quinn&#x2019;s bald head had moved while he cleaned my scrape in a very personal way, the firm grip his big warm fingers had had on my leg . . .</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;ll do,&#x201d; Alfred said, and began snapping away. Claude put his hand on my bare thigh when he could feel my muscles begin to tremble from the effort of holding the position. Once again, a man had a hold of my leg. Claude gripped my thigh enough to give it some support. That helped considerably, but it wasn&#x2019;t a bit erotic.</p> <p>&#x201c;Now some bed shots,&#x201d; Al said, just when I&#x2019;d decided I couldn&#x2019;t stand it any more.</p> <p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Claude and I said in chorus.</p> <p>&#x201c;But that&#x2019;s part of the package,&#x201d; Al said. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to undress, you know. I don&#x2019;t do that kind of picture. My wife would kill me. You just lie down on the bed like you are. Claude hikes up on one elbow and looks down at you, Miss Stackhouse.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said firmly. &#x201c;Take some pictures of him standing by himself in the water. That would be better.&#x201d; There was a fake pond over in the corner, and shots of Claude, apparently naked, dripping water over his bare chest would be extremely appealing (to any woman who hadn&#x2019;t actually met him).</p> <p>&#x201c;How does that grab you, Claude?&#x201d; Al asked.</p> <p>Claude&#x2019;s narcissism chimed in. &#x201c;I think that would be great, Al,&#x201d; he said, trying not to sound too excited.</p> <p>I started for the changing room, eager to shed the costume and get back into my regular jeans. I glanced around for a clock. I was due at work at five-thirty, and I had to drive back to Bon Temps and grab my work uniform before ...</p></p><h2>Shadowrun Fifth Edition*OP</h2><p>&#34;Created by Jordan Weisman ...

Presented in a handsome boxed set, these three beautifully bound hardcovers are an essential addition to every American history collection. <br> <br> Taking the reader from the drama of Jefferson Davis&#x2019;s resignation from the United States Senate and Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s arrival in the nation&#x2019;s capital to Davis&#x2019;s final flight and capture and Lincoln&#x2019;s tragic death, Foote covers his subject with astonishing depth and scope. Every battle, every general, and every statesman has its place in this monumental narrative, told in lively prose that captures the sights, smells, and sounds of the conflict. Never before have the great battles and personalities of the Civil War been so excitingly presented, and never before has the story been told so completely. <br> <br> With a novelist&#x2019;s gift for narrative and a historian&#x2019;s commitment to research, Shelby Foote&#x2019;s epic retelling is the definitive account of the Civil War, a trilogy that has earned a place of honor on the bookshelves of all Americans.</p><p>This beautifully written trilogy of books on the American Civil War is not only a piece of first-rate history, but also a marvelous work of literature. Shelby Foote brings a skilled novelist's narrative power to this great epic. Many know Foote for his prominent role as a commentator on Ken Burns's PBS series about the Civil War. These three books, however, are his legacy. His southern sympathies are apparent: the first volume opens by introducing Confederate President Jefferson Davis, rather than Abraham Lincoln. But they hardly get in the way of the great story Foote tells. This hefty three volume set should be on the bookshelf of any Civil War buff. <i>--John Miller</i>icksburg to Meridian&#34; is full of the life of the times--the elections of 1863, the resignations of Seward and Chase, and the inescapable resolution that the war must go on.

She succeeds brilliantly. Potentially life-altering desserts include the elaborate Le President cake (a genoise filled with chocolate ganache and brandied cherries) and the easy-to-make but elegant chocolate parfait. Cakes are stuffed with everything from chestnut buttercream to tea-flavored ganache; recipes for souffles, cookies, meringues and even the humble brownie can be found. Extremely well organized, with much helpful advice on handling delicate pastries, recipes call for proper equipment, high-quality ingredients and careful adherence to preparation. So when Beranbaum says flour should be spooned instead of scooped into a cup, readers should take her direction literally.

The Glory Of Byzantium explores four interrelated themes: the religious and secular culture of the Second Golden Age of the Byzantine Empire; the empire's interaction with its Christian neighbors and rivals; its relations with the Islamic East; and its contact with the Latin West. Bringing together the contributions of 59 scholars and art historians, the text explores the complex currents of Byzantine civilization. More than 350 works of art assembled from 119 institutions in 24 countries are discussed and illustrated in the catalogue, presenting a significant selection of works that survive from the empire and from the countries that constituted its extended sphere of influence. Liturgical objects (including icons, mosaics, chalices, ceramics, jewelry, and manuscripts) reflect the dynamic nature of the art of this era both within and outside of the empire. The first half of the volume treats the historical context, the religious sphere, and the secular courtly realm of the empire; the second half focuses on the interactions between Byzantium and other medieval cultures, including Islam and the Latin West. The seventeen essays are accompanied by views of architectural sites and comparative illustrations. The Glory Of Byzantium is a highly recommended for academic or community libraries, and would be especially appropriate as a Memorial Fund acquisition selection. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i>The catalog of a major exhibition on Byzantium that just closed at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, this exquisitely produced volume contains essays by leading scholars that describe the objects exhibited and place them within a specific area of the Byzantine empire. Speros Vryonis Jr. leads off the collection with an essay on "Byzantine Society and Civilization." Other notable sections include Toli Kalavezou's "Luxury Objects," Jerry Folda's "Crusader Art," and S. Peter Crowe's "The Georgians." The editors' discussion of the culture of the period is quite thorough and offers new insights. The quality of the reproductions is very good, and both the extensive bibliography and the glossary are highly useful. One only wishes that the footnotes appeared at the bottom of the page rather than at the back of the volume.

Marshall III</b> is an acclaimed historian and author of six previous books, including the bestselling <i>The Journey of Crazy Horse</i> and <i>The Lakota Way</i>. Marshall was raised on the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation in South Dakota and now lives in the Southwest. Marshall was an actor in and consultant and narrator for TNT�&#x2019;s award-winning miniseries <i>Into the West</i>.America's westward expansion in the 19th century was far from a foregone conclusion to the thousands of indigenous peoples, whose ancient way of life lay in its path. Historian Marshall (<i>The Journey of Crazy Horse</i>; <i>The Lakota Way</i>), who was born on South Dakota's Rosebud Sioux Reservation and has long chronicled the traditions and perspective of the Great Plains tribes, explains the context and the painful aftermath of this major turning point in his people's history. His careful description of the Greasy Grass Fight of 1876 (or the Battle of the Little Bighorn) overturns the popular misconception that the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne warriors' victory over the U.S. Seventh Cavalry was a "fluke" or, worse still, "a massacre." Yet he also registers the enormity of the change that followed&#x2014;including forced settlement, assimilation and dependency&#x2014;when Crazy Horse surrendered his rifle to a U.S. Army officer less than a year later. Chapters alternately emphasizing strategy, weaponry, beliefs, lifestyle and other areas lend a fractured quality and some redundancy to the narrative. But Marshall's thoughtful reflections and rich detail (much of it drawn from the oral stories of unidentified Lakota elders) also immerse the reader in the experience of a once free people wrestling with an uncertain destiny. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Why does adding cheese make a hamburger a "cheeseburger" whereas adding ketchup does not make it a "ketchupburger"? By the same token, how do we determine which things said at a meeting should be included in the minutes and which ought to be considered "off the record" and officially disregarded? </p><p>In this wide-ranging and provocative book, Eviatar Zerubavel argues that cognitive science cannot answer these questions, since it addresses cognition on only two levels: the individual and the universal. To fill the gap between the Romantic vision of the solitary thinker whose thoughts are the product of unique experience, and the cognitive-psychological view, which revolves around the search for the universal foundations of human cognition, Zerubavel charts an expansive social realm of mind--a domain that focuses on the conventional, normative aspects of the way we think.</p><p>With witty anecdote and revealing analogy, Zerubavel illuminates the social foundation of mental actions such as perceiving, attending, classifying, remembering, assigning meaning, and reckoning the time. What takes place inside our heads, he reminds us, is deeply affected by our social environments, which are typically groups that are larger than the individual yet considerably smaller than the human race. Thus, we develop a nonuniversal software for thinking as Americans or Chinese, lawyers or teachers, Catholics or Jews, Baby Boomers or Gen-Xers. Zerubavel explores the fascinating ways in which thought communities carve up and classify reality, assign meanings, and perceive things, "defamiliarizing" in the process many taken-for-granted assumptions.</p></p><p>Cognitive science addresses cognition on two levels: the individual and the universal.

She continues this tradition with <i>Bright Evening Star</i>, a personal reflection of the mystery and majesty of the Incarnation of Jesus Christ. <i>Bright Evening Star</i> provides a glimpse into the life stories of this prolific author and her encounters with God. With a foreword by John Tesh, L'Engle invites us on a spiritual adventure that leads to hope, joy, and a closer relationship with Jesus. "Christmas," says Madeleine L'Engle, "should be a time of awed silence." If you're looking for a unique and Christ-centered Christmas meditation, <i>Bright Evening Star</i> will be a rich and delightful discovery -- year round!</p><p>"In this warm and welcoming book?Madeleine L'Engle steers us away from the sterile, intellectual approach of Christian scholars and unravels God's entrance into this world with stories and personal reflections. She tosses aside the hat of a theologian and adorns herself in the flowing robes of a host, beckoning us to explore with her the Incarnation of Jesus Christ." <br><b>--from the foreword by John Tesh, recording artist and musician<br><br></b>"L'Engle's <i>Bright Evening Star</i> moves from the mysterious, imaginative faith of childhood, through doubt, inquiry and evolving understanding, to the deep and knowledgeable faith of spiritual maturity--truly, the Incarnation played out in a human life. You'll find your own story here."<br><b>--Molly Wolf, author of <i>Angels and Dragons: Of Sorrow, God and Healing<br></i></b>Madeleine L'Engle is the author of more than forty-five books for all ages, among them the beloved <i>A Wrinkle in Time,</i> awarded the Newbery Medal; <i>A Ring of Endless Light,</i> a Newbery Honor Book; <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet,</i> winner of the American Book Award; and the Austin family series of which <i>Troubling a Star</i> is the fifth book. L'Engle was named the 1998 recipient of the Margaret A. Edwards award, honoring her lifetime contribution in writing for teens.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle was born in 1918 in New York City, late in her parents' lives,an only child growing up in an adult world. Her father was a journalist who had been a foreign correspondent, and although he suffered from mustard gas poisoning in World War I, his work still took him abroad a great deal. Her mother was a musician; the house was filled with her parents' friends: artists, writers, and musicians. "Their lives were very full and they didn't really have time for a child," she says. "So I turned to writing to amuse myself."<br><br>When she was 12, Ms. L'Engle moved with her family to the French Alps in search of purer air for her father's lungs. She was sent to an English boarding school --"dreadful," she says. When she was 14, her family returned to America and she went to boarding school once again, Ashley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina--which she loved. When she was 17, her father died.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle spent the next four years at Smith College. After graduating cum laude, she and an assortment of friends moved to an apartment in Greenwich Village. "I still wanted to be a writer; I always wanted to be a writer, but I had to pay the bills, so I went to work in the theater," she says.<br><br>Touring as an actress seems to have been a catalyst for her. She wrote her first book, <i>The Small Rain,</i> while touring with Eva Le Gallienne in <i>Uncle Harry</i>. She met Hugh Franklin, to whom she was married until his death in 1986, while they were rehearsing <i>The Cherry Orchard,</i> and they were married on tour during a run of <i>The Joyous Season,</i> starring Ethel Barrymore.<br><br>Ms. L'Engle retired from the stage after her marriage, and the Franklins moved to northwest Connecticut and opened a general store. "The surrounding area was real dairy farmland then, and very rural. Some of the children had never seen books when they began their first year of school," she remembers. The Franklins raised three children--Josephine, Maria, and Bion. Ms. L'Engle's first book in the Austin quintet, <i>Meet the Austins,</i> an ALA Notable Children's Book, has strong parallels with her life in the country. But she says, "I identify with Vicky rather than with Mrs. Austin, since I share all of Vicky's insecurities, enthusiasms, and times of sadness and growth."<br><br>When, after a decade in Connecticut, the family returned to New York, Ms. L'Engle rejoiced. "In some ways, I was back in the real world."

It was about a little G-R-U-L, because that&#x2019;s how I spelled &#x201c;girl&#x201d; when I was 5. I wrote because I wanted to know what everything was about. My father, before I was born, had been gassed in the first World War, and I wanted to know why there wer wars, why people hurt each other, why we couldn&#x2019;t get along together, and what made people tick. That&#x2019;s why I started to write stories.<br><br>The books I read most as a child were by Lucy Maud Montgomery, who&#x2019;s best known for her Anne of Green Gables stories, but I also liked Emily of New Moon. Emily was an only child, as I was. Emily lived on an island, as did I. Although Manhattan Island and Prince Edward Island are not very much alike, they are still islands. Emily&#x2019;s father was dying of bad lungs, and so was mine. Emily had some dreadful relative, and so did I. She had a hard time in school, and she also understood that there&#x2019;s more to life than just the things that can be explained by encyclopedias and facts. Facts alone are not adequate. I love Emily. I also read E. Nesbit, who was a nineteenth-century writer of fantasies and family stories, and I read fairy tales and the myths of all countries. And anything I could get my hands on.<br><br>As an adult, I like to read fiction. I really enjoy good murder mystery writers, usually women, frequently English, because they have a sense of what the human soul is about and why people do dark and terrible things. I also read quite a lot in the area of particle physics and quantum mechanics, because this is theology. This is about the nature of being. This is what life is all about. I try to read as widely as I possibly can.<br><br>I wrote <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> when we were living in a small dairy farm village in New England. I had three small children to raise, and life was not easy. We lost four of our closest friends within two years by death--that&#x2019;s a lot of death statistically. And I really wasn&#x2019;t finding the answers to my big questions in the logical places. So, at the time I discovered the world of particle physics. I discovered Einstein and relativity. I read a book of Einstein&#x2019;s, in which he said that anyone who&#x2019;s not lost in rapturous awe at the power and glory of the mind behind the universe is as good as a burnt-out candle. And I thought, &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;ve found my theologian, what a wonderful thing.&#x201d; I began to read more in that area. <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> came out of these questions, and out of my discovery of the post-utopian sciences, which knocked everything we knew about science for a loop.<br><br><i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> was almost never published. You can&#x2019;t name a major publisher who didn&#x2019;t reject it. And there were many reasons. One was that it was supposedly too hard for children. Well, my children were 7, 10, and 12 while I was writing it. I&#x2019;d read to them at night what I&#x2019;d written during the day, and they&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Ooh, mother, go back to the typewriter!&#x201d; <i>A Wrinkle in Time&#x201d; </i>had a female protagonist in a science fiction book, and that wasn&#x2019;t done. And it dealt with evil and things that you don&#x2019;t find, or didn&#x2019;t at that time, in children&#x2019;s books. When we&#x2019;d run through forty-odd publishers, my agent sent it back. We gave up. Then my mother was visiting for Christmas, and I gave her a tea party for some of her old friends. One of them happened to belong to a small writing group run by John Farrar, of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, which at that time did not have a juvenile list. She insisted that I meet John any how, and I went down with my battered manuscript. John had read my first novel and liked it, and read this book and loved it. That&#x2019;s how it happened.<br><br>The most asked question that I generally receive is, &#x201c;Where do you get your ideas?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s very easily answered. I tell a story about Johann Sebastian Bach when he was an old man. A student asked him, &#x201c;Papa Bach, where do you get the ideas for all of these melodies?&#x201d; And the old man said, &#x201c;Why, when I get up in the morning, it&#x2019;s all I can do not to trip over them.&#x201d; And that&#x2019;s how ideas are; they&#x2019;re just everywhere. I think the least asked question is one that I got in Japan. This little girl held up her hand and said, &#x201c;How tall are you?&#x201d; In Japan, I am very tall.<br><br>I get over one hundred letters a week. There are always letters that stand out. There was one from a 12-year-old girl in North Carolina who wrote me many years ago, saying &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Jewish and most of my friends are Christian. My Christian friends told me only Christians can be saved. What do you think? Your books have made me trust you.&#x201d; Well, we corresponded for about twenty years. I suggested that she go back to read some of the great Jewish writers to find out about her own tradition. Another letter asked, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re studying the crusades in school. Can there be such a thing as a Holy War? Is war ever right?&#x201d; I mean, kids don&#x2019;t hesitate to ask questions. And it&#x2019;s a great honor to have the kids say, &#x201c;Your books have made me trust you.&#x201d;<br><br>The questions are not always about the books. They&#x2019;re sometimes about the deepest issues of life. &#x201c;Why did my parents put my grandmother in a nursing home?&#x201d; That&#x2019;s one that has come up several times. The letters are enlightening, particularly when t...</p><h2>Shiloh</h2><p>This fictional re-creation of the battle of Shiloh in April 1862 fulfills the standard set by his monumental history, conveying both the bloody choreography of two armies and the movements of the combatants' hearts and minds.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>In the novel <i>Shiloh</i>, historian and Civil War expert Shelby Foote delivers a spare, unflinching account of the battle of Shiloh, which was fought over the course of two days in April 1862. By mirroring the troops' movements through the woods of Tennessee with the activity of each soldier's mind, Foote offers the reader a broad perspective of the battle and a detailed view of the issues behind it. The battle becomes tangible as Foote interweaves the observations of Union and Confederate officers, simple foot soldiers, brave men, and cowards and describes the roar of the muskets and the haze of the gun smoke. The author's vivid storytelling creates a rich chronicle of a pivotal battle in American history.Shelby Foote was born on November 7, 1916 in Greenville, Mississippi, and attended school there until he entered the University of North Carolina. During World War II he served as a captain of field artillery but never saw combat. After World War II he worked briefly for the Associated Press in their New York bureau. In 1953 he moved to Memphis, where he lived for the remainder of his life.<br><br>Foote was the author of six novels: <b>Tournament</b>, <b>Follow Me Down</b>, <b>Love in a Dry Season</b>, <b>Shiloh</b>, <b>Jordan County</b>, and <b>September, September</b>. He is best remembered for his 3-volume history <b>The Civil War: A Narrative</b>, which took twenty years to complete and resulted in his being a featured expert in Ken Burns' acclaimed Civil War documentary. Over the course of his writing career, Foote was also awarded three Guggenheim fellowships.<br><br>Shelby Foote died in 2005 at the age of 88.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Henry Climbs a Mountain (A Henry Book)</h2><p>Henry wants to climb a mountain, and nothing is going to stop him. Then Sam, the tax collector, puts him in jail for not paying his taxes. Henry refuses to pay to a state that allows slavery. But being locked up doesn&#x2019;t stop Henry. He still gets to splash in rivers, swing from trees, and meet a stranger. This bear, modeled on the real Henry David Thoreau, roams free.</p><p>D. B. Johnson has been a freelance illustrator for more than twenty years and has done editorial cartoons, comic strips, and conceptual illustrations for magazines and newspapers around the country. Mr. Johnson&#x2019;s first picture book, Henry Hikes to Fitchburg, was a New York Times bestseller and a Publishers Weekly bestseller, as well as an American Bookseller &#x201c;Pick of the Lists.&#x201d; Henry Hikes to Fitchburg also won numerous awards, including the Boston Globe&#x2013;Horn Book Award for Picture Books and the Ezra Jack Keats New Writer Award. Mr. Johnson and his wife, Linda, live in New Hampshire.Grade 1-3-In his third book based on the works of Henry David Thoreau, Johnson tackles the writer's philosophy on civil disobedience. Feeling the yen for a mountain hike, Henry the bear sets off to retrieve one of his shoes from the cobbler. But before he can pick it up, he is jailed for nonpayment of taxes. While there, Henry uses crayons and his imagination to create for himself a new shoe, trees, and a mountain path to explore. At the top of his imaginary mountain, he meets an unnamed, barefoot traveler. Although the stranger's comments indicate that he is an escaped slave seeking freedom, his fur is the same color as Henry's-they are, after all, both bears. Henry gives the traveler his shoes and best wishes, then returns barefoot to his cell. Despite dealing with complex themes, Johnson's text does a fine job of explaining the essential conflicts without oversimplifying them. The colored-pencil-and-paint illustrations, filled with stylized, geometric forms, incorporate natural and historical details, such as posters offering rewards for the return of escaped slaves. Notes at the end offer more information about Thoreau and his writings, which explain the story's origins and deeper themes. Children will also enjoy the book as a tale of triumphant imagination akin to Crockett Johnson's Harold and the Purple Crayon (1955) or Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are (1988, both HarperCollins). Fans of Henry's first two adventures will welcome this title, as will adults seeking to begin discussions on ethical behavior or human rights.<br><i>Eve Ortega, Cypress Library, CA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Kings and Queens of England</h2><p>A richly illustrated history of the lives and reigns of the Kings and Queens of England.

By the author of Slow Kill. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Michael McGarrity has served as an instructor at the New Mexico Law Enforcement Academy and as an investigator for the New Mexico Public Defender&#39;s Office.Returning from 2004's <i>Slow Kill</i>, stoic Sante Fe police chief Kevin Kerney receives an unexpected visit from Johnny Jordan, a childhood friend and now cantankerous former rodeo pro, who convinces Kerney to serve as a technical adviser in the shooting of a local western film. Eager for a break, Kerney heads to the location in southwestern Bootheel with his lovely wife, Army Lt. Col. Sara Brannon, and his young son, Patrick, in tow. But what starts out as a working vacation in this seventh Kerney outing quickly detours into a bloody crime scene when the body of an undercover Border Patrol agent is dumped onto Highway 81. In no time, U.S. Customs joins Kerney's investigation into a possible illegal immigrant and drug smuggling operation. Meanwhile, Sara's army job unexpectedly takes her to Ireland where she must track down and seize the notorious George Spalding, a gemstone smuggler and wartime deserter. McGarrity focuses on the details of the settings and on the characters' tactical maneuvers career- and parenting-wise. The result is slightly amplified sleuthing, deftly swapped out at surprising moments to the POV of the bad guys, and with fine but low-grade intensity. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Kennedy, and his drug abuse and death</p><p>From Bobby-Sox idol to Kennedy spouse and Marylin Monroe intimate, his life was a dizzying whirl of sex, scandal, an secrets even the tabloids dared not print... Once, Peter Lawford seemed to have it all: a handsome face, a sophisticated wit, a talent that won him overnight stardom and entree into a world of beautiful, powerful people. Veteran of film roles in <i>Easter Parade, Little Women, Good News,</i> and <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, the actor had romanced screen sirens Ava Gardner, Lana Turner, and Rita Hayworth; joined Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack; become one of sex goddess Marilyn Monroe's closest confidants; and capped it off by marrying into the famed Kennedy clan. But beneath the glamour of his movie-star life, his fairy-tale marriage, and his legendary friends, lived a man beset by childhood demons that would lead him into alcohol, drugs, shocking sexual escapades--and a controversial role in the cover-up of Marilyn Monroe's death. Now, renowned biographer James Spada tells the fascinating, heartrending story of this deeply troubled man, destined to be remembered best for the secrets he took to his grave... revealed here for the first time.<p></p><p>"Engrossing... tells [Lawford's] frequently tragic story in well-documented detail."--<i>Chicago Tribune</i>.</p><p></p><p>"Fascinating."--<i>Cosmopolitan</i>.</p><p></p><p>"A compelling morality tale, largely because Lawford's life was more Dickensian than Dickens. Compulsive reading."--<i>Los Angeles Times</i>.</p><p></p><p>"Truly titillates."-<i>Daily News</i>, <i>New York</i></p>Lawford starred in surprisingly few grade-A films. Nevertheless, the charm he displayed in movies such as Good News (1947) and Little Women (1949), as well as in clubs and television made him a household name. Biographer Spada ( Monroe, Her Life in Pictures , LJ 10/1/82) balances Lawford's professional and personal lives as the ultimately self-destructive actor never could. Spada chronicles Lawford's British heritage, marriages to Pat Kennedy and less famous women, close friendships with Marilyn Monroe, Judy Garland, and Jackie Kennedy, and his descent into alcohol and drug abuse. This excellently written, thoroughly researched and documented portrait is as compelling as it is distressing.

A highly skilled musician, Stampa produced some of the most musical poetry in the Italian language. Her sonnets of unrequited love speak in a language of honest passion and profound loss. They look forward to the women writers of the nineteenth century and are a milestone in women&#39;s literature. This dual-language edition of selected poems presents, along with the Italian original, the first English translation of Stampa&#39;s work. It includes an introduction to the poet and her work, a note on the translation, and provides the reader with notes to the poems, a bibliography, and a first-line index. Dual-language poetry. Introduction, bibliography, first-line index.</p><p>Gaspara Stampa was born in Padua in 1523. After the death of her father Bartolomeo in 1530 Stampa&#39;s mother, Cecilia, moves with her three children to her native Venice. In 1548 at Christmas time Stampa meets Collaltino di Collalto who will be the focal point of many of her poems. In 1549, however, Collaltino leaves for France to fight against the English in the service of Henry II, king of France. In 1550 Stampa becomes a member of the Accademia dei Dubbiosi under the name of &#34;Anaxilla.&#34; Toward the end of the year Collaltino again returns to Venice, and Stampa spends time with him at his estate, but by the end of the year, deeply depressed, she returns to Venice, marking the end of her relationship with Collaltino and the beginning of a new relationship with Bartolomeo Zen. Between 1551 and 1552, with improving health, Stampa enjoys a period of relative tranquillity. But the following year her health worsens, and she spends a few months in Florence hoping that the milder climate may cure her. She then returns to Venice, becomes ill with a high fever, and after fifteen days she dies on April 23, 1554. The register of her parish notes that she died of fever and colic, and of mal de mare (Venetian literally for disease of the matrix). In October, Pietrasanta publishes the first edition of Stampa&#39;s poetry, edited by her sister Cassandra.Chi vuol conoscer, donne, il mio signore, <br>miri un signor di vago e dolce aspetto, <br>giovane d'anni e vecchio d'intelletto, <br>imagin de la gloria e del valore: <br>di pelo biondo, e di vivo colore, <br>di persona alta e spazioso petto, <br>e finalmente in ogni opra perfetto, <br>fuor ch'un poco (oim lassa!) empio in amore. <br>E chi vuol poi conoscer me, rimiri <br>una donna in effetti ed in sembiante <br>imagin de la morte e de' martri, <br>un albergo di f salda e costante, <br>una, che, perch pianga, arda e sospiri, <br>non fa pietoso il suo crudel amante. <p>If, ladies, you desire to know my lord, <br>Look for a gentleman with sweet expression, <br>Though young in years, old in his intellect; <br>Image of valor and of warlike glory; <br>His hair is blond, and his complexion light, <br>He's tall in stature, with a manly chest, <br>Seeming perfection in his every act, <br>But, ah, in love not faithful to his word. <br>If you should care to know me, you might see, <br>A lady in her manner and appearance <br>Like Death herself and every kind of sorrow, <br>An inn of steady faith and constancy, <br>One who, for all her tears, her ardent sighs, <br>Can win no pity from her cruel lover.</p></p><h2>Undercover: Memoirs of An American Secret Agent</h2><p>RustyRiver offers fast daily shipping and 100% customer satisfaction GUARANTEED!

The economic narratives that underpinned these eras&#x2015;the gold standard, the Bretton Woods regime, the "Washington Consensus"&#x2015;brought great success and great failure. In this eloquent challenge to the reigning wisdom on globalization, Dani Rodrik offers a new narrative, one that embraces an ineluctable tension: we cannot simultaneously pursue democracy, national self-determination, and economic globalization. When the social arrangements of democracies inevitably clash with the international demands of globalization, national priorities should take precedence. Combining history with insight, humor with good-natured critique, Rodrik's case for a customizable globalization supported by a light frame of international rules shows the way to a balanced prosperity as we confront today's global challenges in trade, finance, and labor markets.</p><p>Dani Rodrik, a prize-winning economist, is the Ford Foundation Professor of International Political Economy at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He is the author of The Globalization Paradox&nbsp;and&nbsp;Economics Rules.&#x201c;Takes on the biggest issue of our time&#x2015;globalization&#x2015;and eloquently enlarges the debate about the extent and limits of global cooperation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Gordon Brown</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Dani Rodrik may be globalization&#x2019;s most prominent&#x2015;and most thoughtful&#x2015;gadfly. In <em>The Globalization Paradox</em> he wonders aloud whether extreme globalization undermines democracy&#x2015;and vice versa. Read it and you&#x2019;ll wonder too.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alan S. Blinder, former vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s Board of Governors</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In this powerfully argued book, Dani Rodrik makes the case for country-specific paths to economic development and saner, more sustainable forms of growth. A provocative look at the excesses of hyperglobalization, <em>The Globalization Paradox</em> should be required reading for those who seek to prevent the financial crises and unfair trade practices that feed the backlash against the open markets.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nouriel Roubini coauthor of Crisis Economics: A Crash Course in the Future of Finance</strong><br><br>&#x201c;In this cogent, well-written book, Rodrik, a Harvard economist, critiques unalloyed globalization enthusiasts, taking aim at their desire to fully liberalize foreign trade and capital movements.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Richard N. Cooper, <em>Foreign Affairs</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Although [Rodrik&#x2019;s] message is nuanced and rigorous, drawing on history, logic and the latest economic data, he manages to convey it in simple, powerful prose that any reader can follow....a much-needed addendum to [Adam] Smith&#x2019;s famous formulation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Steven Pearlstein, <em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Simply the best recent treatment of the globalization dilemma that I've read, by an economist or anyone else....He gives us nothing less than a general theory of globalization, development, democracy, and the state. The book provides the pleasure of following a thoughtful, critical mind working through a complex puzzle. Rodrik writes in highly friendly and nontechnical prose, blending a wide-ranging knowledge of economic history and politics and a gentle, occasionally incredulous, skepticism about the narrow and distorting lens of his fellow economists.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert Kuttner, <em>The American Prospect</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A Big Book, one that may shape a new way of thinking about the global economy. . . . The style is conversational, but sweeping and authoritative&#x2015;professorial in the positive sense. Rodrik is less of a polemicist . . . preferring to stay inside the tent, but he can pack a polite punch when necessary.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Duncan Green, Oxfam International, author of From Poverty to Power</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Rodrik is exactly what the doctor ordered because economics over the past few years has become hyper-politicized (thank you, Paul Krugman) yet never more dismal. Well-written, witty, crafted by an author who doesn&#x2019;t jump the "Freakonomics" shark, <em>The Globalization Paradox</em> reminds us that economists don&#x2019;t exist without data, and data comes, ultimately, from the vision and labor of those in the marketplace.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robert Nersesian, <em>New York Journal of Books</em></strong></p><h2>The Summer Queen (Questar Science Fiction)</h2><p>Moon, reigning as the Snow Queen, tries to keep her people from the tyranny of the Hegemony, while solving the mystery of the otherworldly Mers</p><p><p><b>Joan D. Vinge</b> has won two Hugo Awards, one for her novel <i>The Snow Queen</i>. Author of ten novels and a number of film adaptations, her books have been bestsellers here and abroad. She lives in Madison, Wisconsin.</p>TIAMAT: The Windwards <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The hand released the bright ribbon of scarf, and it fluttered down. A hundred eager voices made one voice as the cluster of young girls exploded down the shining strand of beach. <br>Clavally Bluestone Summer sat watching on the cliff high above, feeling the sea wind against her face, feeling it sweep back her long, dark hair. Smiling, she closed her eyes and imagined that it was the wind of motion, that she was running with the others down below. She had run when she was a girl in races like this one, on so many islands across the Summer seas; hoping to be the winner, to be the Sea Mother's Chosen for the three days of the clan festival, garlanded with necklaces of clattering polished shells, fed the best and the sweetest of foods, given new clothes, honored by the elders, flirted with by all the young men.&#x2026; <br>Her smile turned wistful; she fingered the trefoil pendant that gleamed in the sunlight against the laces of her loose homespun shirt. It had been a long time since she had run in one of those races. She had been a sibyl for nearly half her life now. <i>How was it possible</i>&#x2026;? She opened her eyes, filling them with the endless bluegreen of sea and sky, ever-changing and yet ever constant; the mottled clouds, the shimmering ephemera of rainbows from a distant squall. The Twins smiled down on their gathering today, warming her shoulders with luxuriant heat. Spring was in the air, making her remember with longing her body's own springtime. <br>She glanced over her shoulder at the sound of footsteps. Her smile widened as she saw her husband making his way up the path with a basket of fish cakes and bread, a jug of beer in his other hand. She saw the gray-shot brown of his braided hair, his own trefoil gleaming in the sunlight. <br>Her smile faded as she watched him struggle up the steep hill. The stiffness in his joints was getting worse every year--too many years spent in drafty stone rooms, or making cold, wet crossings from island to island for weeks at a time. Danaquil Lu was a Winter; he had not been bred to the hard life of a Summer, and his body rebelled against it. But he rarely spoke any word of complaint or regret, because he belonged here, where he was free to live his life as a sibyl&#x2026;and because his heart belonged to her. <br>The weather was warming; the Summer Star was brightening in their sky, Summer had come into its own. Perhaps the warmer days would ease his pain. Her smile came back as she saw his eyes, bright and bluegreen like the sea, smiling up at her. <br>He sat down with the basket of food, trying not to grimace. She put an arm around his shoulders, massaging his back gently as she pointed down at the beach. "Look, it's almost over!" Another shout rose from the watchers below as the runners reached the finish line drawn in the wet sand. They watched a young girl with a bright flag of yellow hair sprint across the line first, watched her being embraced and garlanded and borne away. <br>"It was a good race, Dana," she said, hearing the memories in her voice. <br>Danaquil Lu sighed, nodding; but somehow the gesture felt to her as if he had shaken his head. "We're young for such a short time," he murmured, "and we're old for such a long time." <br>She turned to look at him. "Come now," she said, too cheerfully, because she had been feeling the same way. "How can you say that on a day like this?" and she kissed him, to make certain he didn't try to answer. <br>He laughed in surprise. They ate together, enjoying the day and each other's company, an hour of solitude stolen from the questions of the festival-goers in the village below. <br>They came down the hill again at last. A clan gathering was always a joyful time--a time for being reunited with relatives and friends from all across the scattered islands of Summer; for remembering the Sea Mother, giving the Lady the tribute She deserved. This was the annual gathering of the Goodventures, one of the largest clans in the islands. They had been the religious leaders of Summer before the last Change--the clan of the previous Summer Queens--and they still held great influence. <br>Down by the stone wall of the quay the winner of the footrace, a laughing, freckled girl of no more than fourteen, was tossing the ritual offerings of worshipers and supplicants into the restless green water. Out in the bay, several mers from the colony that shared this island's shores looked on, a sure sign of the Sea's blessing. Clavally watched the girl's face, the sunlight radiant in her hair, and felt a sudden, unexpected surge of longing. <br>She had made a choice when she became a sibyl. It was a hard, restless life, traveling from island to island, speaking the Lady's wisdom to those who needed her, seeking out and training the ones who would follow after her, to guide a new generation of Summers. They said that it was "death to kill a sibyl, death to love a sibyl, death to be a sibyl."&#x2026;Few if any men who were not sibyls themselves would dare to be a husband to one. <br>But even after she had met Danaquil Lu, she had gone on taking childbane, because it was too hard a life to inflict on a child, and she had no close relatives to help her raise one. And Danaquil Lu, with his bent back and aching joints, needed more and more of her care. She squeezed his hand tightly, and told her restless body to be quiet. Soon enough her childbearing time would be past, and the questions in her heart would be answered once and for all. <br>"A question, sibyl--?" A boy came up to them hesitantly, his brown braids flopping against his sleeveless linen tunic. His eyes chose Danaquil Lu to ask his question of; she guessed it was probably a question about girls. <br>"Ask, and I will answer." Danaquil Lu spoke the ritual response, smiling kindly. <br>Clavally let go of his hand with a farewell glance, granting the blushing boy privacy. She moved on through the crowd, half-hearing Danaquil Lu's voice behind her murmur " <i>Input</i>&#x2026;" as he fell into the Transfer, and the boy's mumbled question. <br>"Sibyl?" A middle-aged, gray-haired Goodventure woman came up beside her, and Clavally stopped, expecting another question. But before her response could form, the woman said, "Are you going to Carbuncle?" <br>Clavally looked at her blankly. "To Carbuncle? Why?" she asked. <br>"Haven't you heard?" The woman looked annoyingly smug. "The new Summer Queen. She has asked all the sibyls of Summer to make a pilgrimage to the City in the North. She claims it is the Lady's will." <br>Clavally shook her head, expressing her disbelief as much as her ignorance. Carbuncle was the only real city on the entire planet, located far to the north, among the Winter clans. Its name meant both "jewel" and "fester." Tied to the offworlders' starport, it swarmed with their wonders and their corruption during the one-hundred-and-fifty-year cycles with the offworld Hegemony controlled Tiamat. During that time the Snow Queen reigned, the Winters claimed the city and all the lands around it for their own--and sibyls were forbidden in Carbuncle. The offworlders despised them, the Winters hated and feared them. Danaquil Lu had been born in the city, but he had been exiled when he became a sibyl. <br>But now the Change had come again. The Black Gate that the offworlders used to reach Tiamat had closed; the offworlders had gone away, and taken their technology with them. Even now the seas were warming. Gradually they would become too hot for the klee the Summers herded and for many of the fish they netted at sea. The mers, the Sea Mother's other children, were migrating north, and the Summers were preparing for their own migration as well. Their ways would become this world's ways again, as the Winters relearned the old rules of survival and harmony with the Sea, and the Summer Queens showed them the human face of the Lady's wisdom. <br>"But why would the Summer Queen--or the Lady--want sibyls in the city," Clavally asked, "and not among the people, helping them to find the way to their new lives?" <br>"She said that she wanted to tell all the sibyls of a greater purpose, their true purpose, that had been revealed to her by the Sea Mother." The Goodventure woman shrugged and wiped her perspiring face. "But there are those who ask, What possible purpose could a sibyl find, which is better than to do what you do now--?" <br>"Yes," Clavally murmured uncertainly. "It's a strange request." <br>"What is?" Danaquil Lu came up beside her, raising his eyebrows. <br>"The Summer Queen has asked all the sibyls to come to Carbuncle, so that she can speak to them," she said. And she watched her husband's face turn ashen. The scars on his cheek--the cruel legacy of his casting-out from Carbuncle--suddenly stood out like a brand. He took hold of her arm, not-quite-casually, steadying himself. <br>"Oh," was all he said. He took a deep breath, filling his lungs with clear sea air. <br>"We needn't go," Clavally said softly, looking up at him. "There will be enough others without us." <br>"A wise decision. But why do you look like the news brings you no joy, Clavally Bluestone?" A heavyset, weathered woman joined them; Clavally recognized Capella Goodventure, the clan headwoman. <br>Clavally didn't answer, looking back at Danaquil Lu, who was gazing out to sea as if he were suddenly there alone. <br>"Or your pledged, either," Capella said, her voice prying like fingers. "What clan is he with--?" Clavally heard the tone in her voice which said she knew the answer, although Danaquil Lu wore no embroidery on his shirt, no token of clan membership. <br>"Wayaways," Danaquil Lu said flatly, looking back at her. His expression said that he recognized the tone in her voice, too. <br>"Wayaways? But isn't that a Winter clan?" Capella said, with sour insinuation. The sound of her surprise rang as false as a cracked bell. "I would think you'd be eager to return to your home." <br>"It isn't my home," he snapped. "I am a sibyl." <br>"Of course you are." She stared at his trefoil. "A Winter who worships the Lady. Aren't you unusual." She rubbed her arms, looking out at the sea. <br>Danaquil Lu looked away from her again, irritation plain on his face. He did not believe in the Lady; or in anything at all except his calling. But the Lady believed in him. Clavally looked back at Capella Goodventure, frowning. She had never been fond of the Goodventures' elder. She was becoming less fond of her now with every heartbeat. She opened her mouth to inquire whether Capella had a question to ask, or not. <br>"I would go nowhere near the City, if I were a sibyl," Capella said, looking back at her. "I was in Carbuncle at the last Festival. It was my duty to oversee the crowning of the Summer Queen--and the drowning of the Snow Queen." She smiled slightly; Clavally tightened her jaw, and held her tongue. "And what I saw then made me wonder whether the Lady has abandoned Carbuncle forever." <br>"What do you mean?" Clavally asked, her curiosity forcing the words out against her will. <br>"The new queen claims to be a sibyl." <br>Clavally's eyes widened. Her hand touched the trefoil hanging against her chest. "But isn't that a good--" <br>"--But," Capella Goodventure went on, relentlessly, "she's white as snow; she looks exactly like the old queen, Arienrhod." Her voice dripped vitriol. "She forsook the proper rituals of the Change; she speaks blasphemies about the Lady's will. She chooses to live in the Snow Queen's palace--and she went so far as to have me turned out of it when I tried to show her how her willfulness could harm us all." <br> <i>Ah</i>, Clavally thought. <br>"The Winter gossip says that she is the old Queen's illegal clone, an unnatural copy of herself, made for her by the offworlders to oppress us," Capella Goodventure went on. "She couldn't possibly be a Summer, even though she claims to belong to the Dawntreader clan--" <br>"The Dawntreaders?" Clavally said, startled. "I knew a sibyl of the Dawntreaders, about five years ago. Her name was Moon--" <br>This time it was the Goodventure woman who looked surprised. <br>"Is she the new Queen?" Clavally asked, incredulous. She read the answer in the other woman's eyes. <br>"You know her?" Capella Goodventure demanded. "What did she look like?" <br>"She would be young, and very fair--her hair was almost white. Her eyes were a strange, shifting color, like fog-agates.&#x2026;" She knew again, from the look on the other woman's face, that she had described the new Queen. <br>"She is a sibyl," Danaquil Lu said abruptly. "We trained her ourselves. And she was a Summer. I would have known if she was not." <br>Capella Goodventure looked at him, her eyes narrowing; he met her stare, until finally she was the one who looked away. "She isn't right," she said finally, looking at Clavally again. "I will tell you what I have told every sibyl I've seen--I have to return to the city, but you do not. Don't go to Carbuncle." She turned and started away, her angry momentum splitting the crowd like a ship's wake. <br>Clavally looked at Danaquil Lu, found him already looking at her. "Perhaps the only thing that's truly wrong with the new Queen is that she isn't a Goodventure," she murmured. <br>Danaquil Lu's mouth twitched with a fleeting, ironic smile; the smile disappeared. "What do you really think?" he asked her. <br>She brushed at a fly that was buzzing in her ear like doubt, and felt another frown start to form. "I remember the girl Moon Dawntreader that we knew. She was different&#x2026;there was something about her&#x2026;but I always felt that it was good. I think that I want to know for myself what the truth is, Dana." <br>He nodded, his face pinching. "You want to go to Carbuncle." <br>Slowly she nodded. "But what do you think? What do you feel?&#x2026;What do you want to do?" <br>He looked out across the sea again, squinting with the glare of light on water, looking north. She saw him swallow as if something were caught in his throat. At last he said, "I want to go home." <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 1991 by Joan D.

He is now in private practice using both conventional and homeopathic medicine. </p><p> <b>Dr. Christina Scott-Moncrieff</b> is a general practitioner in private practice and on staff at the Bristol Homeopathic Hospital (U.K.) </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p> <p> Homeopathic medicines have been used for some 200 years to treat a wide variety of illnesses safely and effectively. The word homeopathy means 'like suffering'. It describes the basic principle Of homeopathic treatment: that the symptoms that a person experiences can be cured by a substance that would cause the same symptoms if given to a healthy person. This principle was recognized by Hippocrates 2,400 years ago, but it was not used in a systematic way until Dr Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843) grew tired of the brutal medical practices of his day and began to experiment with other forms of treatment. Using herbs, and later other substances including the medicines of the day, such as arsenic and mercury, Hahnemann gathered a group of healthy people who took the substance he was investigating, and then reported their symptoms. These were called 'provings' and were recorded. They became the basis of the prescriptions Hahnemann later gave to ill people with the same symptoms. </p><p> Taking medicines that caused the same symptoms that a patient was already experiencing sometimes caused an <i>aggravation</i> of the symptoms. To overcome this, Hahnemann devised a method of preparing the medicine by systematically diluting the original medicine, or 'mother tincture', and shaking it vigorously between each dilution. To his surprise, this method enhanced the action of the medicine. He called the method 'potentisation' and the resulting medicines '<i>potencies</i>', thus the highest potencies contain the weakest solutions. </p><p> Hahnemann's method is still used today. The mother tincture is diluted on one of two scales: either one part in ten, or one part in 100. The number of dilutions that a medicine has undergone is recorded on each bottle of medicine by a number, which is usually printed just after the name of the medicine. The dilution scale is indicated by a letter, so <i>x</i> or <i>d&gt;</i> means that each dilution was one part in ten and <i>c</i> denotes dilutions of one part in 100. For example, a medicine which has 6c on it means that the mother tincture has been diluted by one part in a hundred six times. A 1000c dilution is usually denoted as 1M. </p><p> Giving such small doses has always been controversial because the original substance must eventually disappear altogether. Modern chemistry tells us that this occurs at about the 12c dilution, so how can the higher potencies be effective? It is thought the medicine leaves some sort of message in the water during the vigorous shaking between dilutions, and that this message somehow resonates with the body to promote healing. </p><p><b> The Vital Force </b></p> <p> Hahnemann believed that the body contains an innate power to heal itself. He called this the Vital Force. He believed that when a person is ill this force becomes disordered and that homeopathic medicines are able to restore it in a unique way. The choice of medicine depends on the symptoms that are present and is called the <i>symptom medicine</i> in this book. The term local medicine is sometimes also used. In more long-standing illnesses, the Vital Force may put up a good resistance to the progress of the disease, but over a period of time the illness becomes more severe. Symptom medicines may bring some relief, but they rarely cure this type of illness and a <i>constitutional medicine</i> may be needed. Such a prescription is based on the whole personality and appearance of the patient. </p><p><b> How to use this book </b></p> <p> Part one of this book contains information about the problems and ailments that women may encounter during their lives. Each chapter has an introduction that provides more useful information and there are self-help tips. Part two is the <i>Materia Medica</i> section where there is a detailed description of 50 common medicines. </p><p> To select the most appropriate medicine for your current complaint you should: </p><ul> <li>Use the list of book contents and/or index to find the entry that most closely describes the problem. </li><li>Read through the symptoms to find those that best describe your symptoms so that you can select the most appropriate medicine. </li><li>Use the <i>Materia Medica</i> section, where possible, to confirm your choice. The introduction to the <i>Materia Medica</i> will help you use this section. </li><li>You should take the medicine at least half an hour after eating and when your mouth is free of other strong flavors, such as peppermint, toothpaste or tobacco. In an emergency, if you cannot wait, rinse your mouth with water if this is possible. </li><li>Allow the medicine to dissolve in your mouth. </li></ul> <p><b> Taking a course of treatment </b></p> <ul> <li>If the symptoms improve, reduce the frequency of the doses of medicine and stop it altogether when you are symptom free. If the symptoms do return, you need to start taking the recommended medicine again. </li><li>If any of the symptoms get worse you should stop taking the medicine. Even with the very dilute 'potentised' medicines it is possible that you are 'proving' the medicine or experiencing an aggravation (see opposite). This is not necessarily a bad sign, because it shows that the medicine is having an effect, and the reaction will almost always subside within a day or two leaving you symptom free. If some of your symptoms persist, try a few doses in a higher potency, but it is a good idea to check whether another medicine might be more appropriate. If in doubt consult a homeopath. If the symptoms are severe, or if you have other health problems, seek medical help. </li><li>If some symptoms still remain while others improve, you should take the medicine less frequently, eventually stopping it. You will need to change to a different medicine if some symptoms remain. </li><li>If new symptoms appear, stop the medicine. All homeopathic medicines have a wider action than those mentioned in this book and you may be 'proving' the medicine (see opposite). If the symptoms persist consider taking another medicine. </li><li>If your symptoms do not change, try to find a more appropriate medicine. </li><li>If you are concerned about what is happening always seek professional advice. Remember to consult your doctor <i>before</i> you stop any conventional medication or alter the recommended dose. You should also always tell your homeopath what medicines your doctor has prescribed for you </li></ul> <p><b> Further Help </b></p> <p> Homeopathic medicines are increasingly available from drugstores and health food stores. Higher potencies and less common ones can be bought by mail order from a homeopathic manufacturer using a credit card (see p. 173). </p><p> There are organizations in Canada and the United States that maintain lists of registered homeopathic practitioners (see p. 173). Although a growing number of health care providers prescribe homeopathic medicines, not all Jurisdictions have homeopathic licensing boards or require practitioners to pass an examination. In the U.S., the letters DHt after a practitioner's name indicate membership in the specialty board of the American Board of Homeotherapeutics. In Canada, R.Hom or H.D. indicates completion of standardized educational programs.</p></p><h2>Hands a Journey Around the World</h2><p>Language:Chinese.HardCover.

In &#x201c;The Education of a British-Protected Child,&#x201d; Achebe gives us a vivid portrait of growing up in colonial Nigeria and inhabiting its &#x201c;middle ground,&#x201d; recalling both his happy memories of reading novels in secondary school and the harsher truths of colonial rule. In &#x201c;Spelling Our Proper Name,&#x201d; Achebe considers the African-American diaspora, meeting and reading Langston Hughes and James Baldwin, and learning what it means not to know &#x201c;from whence he came.&#x201d; The complex politics and history of Africa figure in &#x201c;What Is Nigeria to Me?,&#x201d; &#x201c;Africa&#x2019;s Tarnished Name,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Politics and Politicians of Language in African Literature.&#x201d; And Achebe&#x2019;s extraordinary family life comes into view in &#x201c;My Dad and Me&#x201d; and &#x201c;My Daughters,&#x201d; where we observe the effect of Christian missionaries on his father and witness the culture shock of raising &#x201c;brown&#x201d; children in America.<br><br>Charmingly personal, intellectually disciplined, and steadfastly wise, <i>The Education of a British-Protected Child</i> is an indispensable addition to the remarkable Achebe oeuvre.</p><p><p><b>Chinua Achebe </b>was born in Nigeria in 1930. His first<b> </b>novel, <i>Things Falls Apart</i>, became a classic of international literature and required reading for students worldwide. He also authored four subsequent novels, two short-story collections, and numerous other books. He was the David and Marianna Fisher University Professor and Professor of Africana Studies at Brown University and, for over 15 years, was the Charles P. Stevenson Jr. Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College. In 2007, Achebe was awarded the Man Booker International Prize for lifetime achievement. He died in 2013.</p>MY DAUGHTERS<br><br>All my life I have had to take account of the millionbdifferences&#x2014;some little, others quite big&#x2014;between the Nigerian culture into which I was born, and the domineering Westernbstyle that infiltrated and then invaded it. Nowhere is the difference more stark and startling than in the ability to ask a parent: &#x201c;How many children do you have?&#x201d; The right answer should be a rebuke: &#x201c;Children are not livestock!&#x201d; Or better still, silence, and carry on as if the question was never asked.<br><br>But things are changing and changing fast with us, and we have been making concession after concession even when the other party shows little sign of reciprocating. And so I have learned to answer questions that my father would not have touched with a bargepole. And to my shame let me add that I suspect I may even be enjoying it, to a certain extent!<br><br>My wife and I have four children&#x2014;two daughters and two sons, a lovely balance further enhanced by the symmetry of their arrivals: girl, boy, boy, girl. Thus the girls had taken strategic positions in the family.<br><br>We, my wife and I, cut our teeth on parenthood with the first girl, Chinelo. Naturally, we made many blunders. But Chinelo was up to it. She taught us. At age four or thereabouts, she began to reflect back to us her experience of her world. One day she put it in words: &#x201c;I am not black; I am brown.&#x201d; We sat up and began to pay attention.<br><br>The first place our minds went was her nursery school, run by a bunch of white expatriate women. But inquiries to the school board returned only assurances. I continued sniffing around, which led me in the end to those expensive and colorful children&#x2019;s books imported from Europe and displayed so seductively in the better supermarkets of Lagos.<br><br>Many parents like me, who never read children&#x2019;s books in their own childhood, saw a chance to give to their children the blessings of modern civilization which they never had and grabbed it. But what I saw in many of the books was not civilization but condescension and even offensiveness.<br><br>Here, retold in my own words, is a mean story hiding behind the glamorous covers of a children&#x2019;s book:<br><br>A white boy is playing with his kite in a beautiful open space on a clear summer&#x2019;s day. In the background are lovely houses and gardens and tree-lined avenues. The wind is good and the little boy&#x2019;s kite rises higher and higher and higher. It flies so high in the end that it gets caught under the tail of an airplane that just happens to be passing overhead at that very moment. Trailing the kite, the airplane flies on past cities and oceans and deserts. Finally it is flying over forests and jungles. We see wild animals in the forests and we see little round huts in the clearing. An African village.<br><br>For some reason, the kite untangles itself at this point and begins to fall while the airplane goes on its way. The kite falls and falls and finally comes to rest on top of a coconut tree.<br><br>A little black boy climbing the tree to pick a coconut beholds this strange and terrifying object sitting on top of the tree. He utters a piercing cry and literally falls off the tree. <br><br>His parents and their neighbors rush to the scene and discuss this apparition with great fear and trembling. In the end they send for the village witch doctor, who appears in his feathers with an entourage of drummers. He offers sacrifices and prayers and then sends his boldest man up the tree to bring down the object, which he does with appropriate reverence. The witch doctor then leads the village in a procession from the coconut tree to the village shrine, where the supernatural object is deposited and where it is worshipped to this day.<br><br>That was the most dramatic of the many imported, beautifully packaged, but demeaning readings available to our children, perhaps given them as birthday presents by their parents.<br><br>So it was that when my friend the poet Christopher Okigbo, representing Cambridge University Press in Nigeria at that time, called on me and said I must write him a children&#x2019;s book for his company, I had no difficulty seeing the need and the urgency. So I wrote <i>Chike and the River</i> and dedicated it to Chinelo and to all my nephews and nieces. <br><br>(I am making everything sound so simple. Children may be little, but writing a children&#x2019;s book is not simple. I remember that my first draft was too short for the Cambridge format, and the editor directed me to look at Cyprian Ekwensi&#x2019;s <i>Passport of Mallam Illia</i> for the length required. I did.)<br><br>With Chinelo, I learned that parents must not assume that all they had to do for books was to find the smartest department store and pick up the most attractive-looking book in stock. Our complacency was well and truly rebuked by the poison we now saw wrapped and taken home to our little girl. I learned that if I wanted a safe book for my child I should at least read it through and at best write it myself.<br><br>Our second daughter, Nwando, gave us a variation on Chinelo&#x2019;s theme eight years later. The year was 1972 and the place Amherst, Massachusetts, where I had retreated with my family after the catastrophic Biafran civil war. I had been invited to teach at the university, and my wife had decided to complete her graduate studies. We enrolled our three older children in various Amherst schools and Nwando, who was two and a half, in a nursery school. And she thoroughly hated it. At first we thought it was a passing problem for a child who had never left home before. But it was more than that. Every morning as I dropped her off she would cry with such intensity I would keep hearing her in my head all three miles back. And in the afternoon, when I went back for her, she would seem so desolate. Apparently she would have said not a single word to anybody all day.<br><br>As I had the task of driving her to this school every morning, I began to dread mornings as much as she did. But in the end we struck a bargain that solved the problem. I had to tell her a story all the way to school if she promised not to cry when I dropped her off. Very soon she added another story all the way back. The agreement, needless to say, taxed my repertory of known and fudged stories to the utmost. But it worked. Nwando was no longer crying. By the year&#x2019;s end she had become such a success in her school that many of her little American schoolmates had begun to call their school<br>Nwando-haven instead of its proper name, Wonderhaven.<br><br>2009</p><h2>The Forrestal Diaries</h2><p>James Vincent Forrestal (February 15, 1892 &#x2013; May 22, 1949) was the last Cabinet-level United States Secretary of the Navy and the first United States Secretary of Defense.

Overcrowded, overbuilt, and overshadowed by a continuous air of menace, this gothic nightmare is a breeding ground for the depraved, the indifferent, and the criminally insane. It's also the object of one man's obsession. Witness to the brutal murder of his parents, Bruce Wayne has dedicated his life to protecting this city, taking a form to inspire hope in the innocent...and fear in the guilty. He is the masked vigilante known as the Batman. <p> Now the battlefield has changed.

In the story line's most indulgent liberty, those fat cats in Washington decide to write off Gotham, � la <i>Escape from New York</i>, blowing up the connecting bridges, mining the surrounding waterways, and signing into law the Federal Declaration of No Man's Land, which makes it a crime to even set foot in the city. The usual suspects from Arkham Asylum, Two-Face and the Penguin, the Riddler and Dr. Freeze, Poison Ivy and Mr. Zsasz, file out to begin running the show, strong-arming and manipulating the block-by-block turf battles that envelop the now-ultraviolent city. A conflicted Batman shows up fashionably late, only to find that these lunatics are the least of his worries: Lex Luthor, Superman's archfoe, has nefarious designs on Gotham too. Could this possibly get any better? Sure, <i>No Man's Land</i> is derivative fiction, but the appeal of Rucka--and, of course, Batman--can make this one worth the read. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>The author of four novels about professional bodyguard Atticus Kodiak -- <i>Keeper</i> (nominated for a Shamus Award by the Private Eye Writers of America), <i>Finder, Smoker,</i> and <i>Shooting at Midnight,</i> <b>Greg Rucka</b> has been writing since he was eight years old, and hopefully is improving with age.

With the destructionof most of the U.S. battleship fleet at Pearl Harbor, cruisers such as Sweet Pea carried the biggest guns the Navy possessed for nearly a year after the start of World War II. <i>Sweet Pea at War</i> describes in harrowing detail how Portland and her sisters protected the precious carriers and held the line against overwhelming Japanese naval strength. Portland was instrumental in the dramatic American victories at the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway, and the naval battle of Guadalcanal&#x2015;conflicts that historians regard as turning points in the Pacific war. She rescued nearly three thousand sailors from sunken ships, some of them while she herself was badly damaged. Only a colossal hurricane ended her career, but she sailed home from that, too. Based on extensive research in official documents and interviews with members of the ship's crew, <i>Sweet Pea at War</i> recounts from launching to scrapping the history of USS Portland, demonstrating that she deserves to be remembered as one of the most important ships in U.S. naval history.</p><p>William Thomas Generous Jr., adjunct associate professor of Peace, War, and Defense at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, is the author of two other books.

(<i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>In this study of the Copernican Revolution, [Thomas Kuhn] brings to a common focus the considered approach of the historian, the technical understanding of the scientist and the skill and experience of an able teacher. No careful reader of this well-wrought volume can fail to appreciate the nicely balanced interplay of these elements in the full explication of one of the major turning points in the evolution of scientific thought. For those concerned with the teaching of the history of science, Dr. Kuhn's discussion of the issues involved in the Copernican Revolution will prove to be indispensable, a superb analysis of the 'anatomy of revolution.' Those drawn to the question of meaning which the historian of science can give to the evolution of ideas will find this book equally valuable, a paradigm of synthesis and interpretation.

Year Twenty-five,&nbsp; the Year of the Flood.<br><br>In the early morning Toby climbs up to the rooftop to watch the sunrise. She uses a mop handle for balance: the elevator stopped working some time ago and the back stairs are slick with damp, so if she slips and topples there won't be anyone to pick her up. As the first heat hits, mist rises from among the swathe of trees between her and the derelict city. The air smells faintly of burning, a smell of caramel and tar and rancid barbecues, and the ashy but greasy smell of a garbage-dump fire after it's been raining. The abandoned towers in the distance are like the coral of an ancient reef--bleached and colourless, devoid of life. There still is life, however. Birds chirp; sparrows, they must be. Their small voices are clear and sharp, nails on glass: there's no longer any sound of traffic to drown them out. Do they notice that quietness, the absence of motors? If so, are they happier? Toby has no idea. Unlike some of the other Gardeners--the more wild-eyed or possibly overdosed ones--she has never been under the illusion that she can converse with birds. The sun brightens in the east, reddening the blue-grey haze that marks the distant ocean. The vultures roosting on hydro poles fan out their wings to dry them, opening themselves like black umbrellas. One and then another lifts off on the thermals and spirals upwards. If they plummet suddenly, it means they've spotted carrion. Vultures are our friends, the Gardeners used to teach. They purify the earth. They are God's necessary dark Angels of bodily dissolution. Imagine how terrible it would be if there were no death!Do I still believe this? Toby wonders. Everything is different up close.<br><br>The rooftop has some planters, their ornamental running wild; it has a few fake-wood benches. It used to have a sun canopy for cocktail hour, but that's been blown away. Toby sits on one of the benches to survey the grounds. She lifts her binoculars, scanning from left to right. The driveway, with its lumirose borders, untidy now as as frayed hairbrushes, their purple glow fading in the strengthening light. The western entrance, done in pink adobe-style solarskin, the snarl of tangled cars outside the gate. The flowerbeds, choked with sow thistle and burdock, enormous aqua kudzu moths fluttering above them. The fountains, their scallop-shell basins filled with stagnant rainwater. The parking lot with a pink golf cart and two pink AnooYoo minibuses, each with its winking-eye logo. There's a fourth minibus further along the drive, crashed into a tree: there used to be an arm hanging out of the window, but it's gone now.The wide lawns have grown up, tall weeds. There are low irregular mounds beneath the milkweed and fleabane and sorrel, with here and there a swatch of fabric, a glint of bone. That's where the people fell, the ones who'd been running or staggering across the lawn. Toby had watched from the roof, crouched behind one of the planters, but she hadn't watched for long. Some of those people had called for help, as if they'd known she was there. But how could she have helped? The swimming pool has a mottled blanket of algae. Already there are frogs. The herons and the egrets and the peagrets hunt them, at the shallow end. For a while Toby tried to scoop out the small animals that had blundered in and drowned. The luminous green rabbits, the rats, the rakunks, with their striped tails and racoon bandit masks. But now she leaves them alone. Maybe they'll attract fish, somehow.Is she thinking of eating these future fish? Surely not. Surely not yet.She turns to the dark encircling wall of trees and vines and fronds and shrubby undergrowth, probing it with her binoculars. It's surely from there that any danger might come. But what kind of danger? She can't imagine.<br><br>In the night there are the usual noises: the faraway barking of dogs, the tittering of mice, the water-pipe notes of the crickets, the occasional grumph of a frog. The blood rushing in her ears: katoush, katoush, katoush. A heavy broom sweeping dry leaves. "Go to sleep," she says out loud. But she never sleeps well, not since she's been alone in this building. Sometimes she hears voices--human voices, calling to her in pain. Or the voices of women, the women who used to work here, the anxious women who used to come, for rest and rejuvenation. Splashing in the pool, strolling on the lawns. All the pink voices, soothed and soothing. Or the voices of the Gardeners, murmuring or singing; or the children laughing together, up on the Edencliff Garden. Adam One, and Nuala, and Burt. Old Pilar, surrounded by her bees. And Zeb. If any one of them is still alive, it must be Zeb. Surely is he on his way, any day now he'll come walking along the roadway or appear from among the trees. But he must be dead by now. It's better to think so. Not to waste hope.There must be someone else left, though; she can't be the only one on the planet. There must be others. But friends or foes? If she sees one, how to tell? She's prepared. The doors are locked, the windows barred. But even such barriers are no guarantee: every hollow space invites invasion. Even when she sleeps, she's listening, as animals do--for a break in the pattern, for an unknown sound, for a silence opening like a crack in rock. When the small creatures hush their singing, said Adam One, it's because they're afraid. You must listen for the sound of their fear.<br><br>2Ren. Year Twenty-five, the year of the Flood.<br><br>Beware of words. Be careful what you write. Leave no trails.This is what the Gardeners taught us, when I was a child among them. They taught us to depend on memory, because nothing written down could be relied on. The Spirit travels from mouth to mouth, not from thing to thing: books could be burnt, paper crumble away, computers could be destroyed. Only the Spirit lives forever, and the Spirit isn't a thing. As for writing, it was dangerous, said the Adams and the Eves, because your enemies could trace you through it, and hunt you down, and use your words to condemn you.But now that the Waterless Flood has swept over us, any writing I might do is safe enough, because those who might have used it against me are surely dead. So I can write down anything I want. What I write is my name, Ren, with an eyebrow pencil, on the wall beside the mirror. I've written it a lot of times. Renrenren, like a song. You can forget who you are if you're alone too much. Amanda told me that. I can't see out the window, it's glass brick. I can't get out the door, it's locked on the outside. I still have air though, and water, as long as the solar doesn't quit. I still have food. I'm lucky. I'm really very lucky. Count your luck, Amanda used to say. So I do. First, I was lucky to be working here at Scales when the Flood hit. Second, it was even luckier that I was shut up this way in the Sticky Zone, because it kept me safe. I got a rip in my Biofilm Bodyglove--a client got carried away and bit me, right through the green sequins and I was waiting for my test results. It wasn't a wet rip with secretions and membranes involved, it was a dry rip near the elbow, so I wasn't that worried. Still, they checked everything, here at Scales. They had a reputation to keep up: we were known as the cleanest dirty girls in town. Scales took care of you, they really did. If you were talent, that is. Good food, a doctor if you needed one, and the tips were great, because the men from the top Corps came here. It was well run, though it was in a seedy area--all the clubs were. That was a matter of image, Mordis would say: seedy was good for business, because unless there's an edge--something lurid or tawdry, a whiff of sleaze--what separated our brand from the run-of-the-mill product the guy could get at home, with the face cream and the white cotton panties? Mordis believed in plain speaking. He'd been in the business ever since he was a kid, and when they outlawed the pimps and the street trade--for public health and the safety of women, they said--and rolled everything into SeksMart under CorpSeCorps control, Mordis made the jump, because of his experience. "It's who you know," he used to say. "And what you know about them." Then he'd grin, and pat you on the bum--just a friendly pat though, he never took freebies from us. He had ethics.He was a wiry guy with a shaved head and black, shiny, alert eyes like the heads of ants, and he was easy as long as everything was cool. But he'd stand up for us if the clients got violent. "Nobody hurts my best girls," he'd say. It was a point of honour with him. Also he didn't like waste: we were a valuable asset, he'd say. The cream of the crop. After the SeksMart roll-in, anyone left outside the system was not only illegal but pathetic. A few wrecked, diseased old women wandering the alleyways, practically begging. No man with even a fraction of his brain left would go anywhere near them. "Hazardous waste," we Scales girls used to call them. We shouldn't have been so scornful; we should have had compassion. But compassion takes work, and we were young. <br><br>That night when the Waterless Flood began, I was waiting for my test results: they kept you locked in the Sticky Zone for weeks, in case you had something contagious. The food came in through the safety-sealed hatchway, plus there was the mini-fridge with snacks, and the water was filtered, coming in and out both. You had everything you needed, but it got boring in there. You could exercise on the machines, and I did a lot of that, because a trapeze dancer needs to keep in practice. You could watch TV or old movies, play your music, talk on the phone. Or you could visit the other rooms in Scales on the intercom video. Sometimes when we doing plank work we'd wink at the cameras in mid-moan for the benefit of whoever was stuck in the Sticky Zone. We knew where the cameras were hidden, in the snakeskin or featherwork on the ceilings. It was one big family, at Scales, so even when you were in the Sticky Zone, Mordis liked you to feel you were still participating.Mordis made me feel so secure.

You wouldn't think it would be Toby--she was so tough and hard--but if you're drowning, a soft squashy thing is no good to hold onto. You need something more solid.<br><br>CREATION DAY<br><br>Year Five.<br><br>Of the Creation, and of the Naming of the Animals.Spoken by Adam One.<br><br>Dear Friends, dear fellow Creatures, dear fellow Mammals: On Creation Day five years ago, this Edencliff Rooftop Garden of ours was a sizzling wasteland, hemmed in by festering city slums and dens of wickedness; but now it has blossomed as the rose. By covering such barren rooftops with greenery we are doing our small part in the redemption of God's Creation from the decay and sterility that lies all around us, and feeding ourselves with unpolluted food into the bargain. Some would term our efforts futile, but if all were to follow our example, what a change would be wrought on our beloved Planet! Much hard work still lies before us, but fear not, my Friends; for we shall move forward undaunted.I am glad we have all remembered our sunhats. <br><br>Now let us turn our minds to our annual Creation Day Devotion. The Human Words of God speak of the Creation in terms that could be understood by the men of old. There is no talk of galaxies or genes, for such terms would have confused them greatly! But must we therefore take as scientific fact the story that the world was created in six days, thus making a nonsense of observable data? God cannot be held to the narrowness of literal and materialistic interpretations, nor measured by Human measurements, for His days are eons, and a thousand ages of our time are like an evening to Him. Unlike some other religions, we have never felt it served a higher purpose to lie to children about geology.Remember the first sentences of those Human Words of God: the Earth is without form, and void, and then God speaks Light into being. This is the moment that Science terms "The Big Bang," as if it were a sex orgy. Yet both accounts concur in their essence: Darkness; then, in an instant, Light. But surely the Creation is ongoing, for are not new stars being formed at every moment? God's Days are not consecutive, my Friends; they run concurrently, the first with the third, the fourth with the sixth. As we are told, "Thou sendeth forth thy Spirit, they are created; and Thou renewest the face of the Earth." We are told that, on the fifth day of God's Creating activities, the waters brought forth Creatures, and on the sixth day the dry land was populated with Animals, and with plants and Trees; and all were blessed, and told to multiply; and finally Adam--that is to say, Mankind--was created. According to Science, this is the same order in which the species did in fact appear on the planet, Man last of all. Or more or less the same order. Or close enough.What happens next? God brings the Animals before Man, "to see what he would call them." But why didn't God already know what names Adam would choose? The answer can only be that God has given Adam free will, and therefore Adam may do things that God Himself cannot anticipate in advance. Think of that the next time you are tempted by meat-eating or material wealth! Even God may not always know what you are going to do next!God must have caused the Animals to assemble by speaking to them directly, but what language did He use? It was not Hebrew, my Friends. It was not Latin or Greek, or English, or French, or Spanish, or Arabic, or Chinese. No: He called the Animals in their own languages. To the Reindeer He spoke Reindeer, to the Spider, Spider; to the Elephant He spoke Elephant, to the Flea He spoke Flea, to the Centipede He spoke Centipede, and to the Ant, Ant. So must it have been.And for Adam himself, the Names of the Animals were the first words he spoke--the first moment of Human language. In this cosmic instant, Adam claims his Human soul. To Name is--we hope--to greet; to draw another towards one's self. Let us imagine Adam calling out the Names of the Animals in fondness and joy, as if to say--There you are, my dearest! Welcome! Adam's first act towards the Animals was thus one of loving-kindness and kinship, for Man in his unfallen state was not yet a carnivore. The Animals knew this, and did not run away. So it must have been on that unrepeatable Day--a peaceful gathering at which every living entity on the Earth was embraced by Man. How much have we lost, dear fellow Mammals and fellow Mortals! How much have we wilfully destroyed! How much do we need to restore, within ourselves! The time of the Naming is not over, my Friends. In His sight, we may still be living in the sixth day. As your Meditation, imagine yourself rocked in that sheltering moment. Stretch out your hand towards those gentle eyes that regard you with such trust--a trust that has not yet been violated by bloodshed and gluttony and pride and disdain. Say their Names. Let us sing.</p><h2>Kursk 1943: The Northern Front (Campaign)</h2><p><p>Kursk 1943 focuses on the northern front and the battle of Kursk, and period of July 5th to August 18th, 1943, covering both the German offensive and the Soviet counteroffensive - Model's AOK 9 pitted against General Konstantin Rokossovsky's Central Front.</p><p>After recovering from the Stalingrad debacle, Hitler intended to conduct a limited objective offensive (using the new Panther and Tiger tanks) in the summer of 1943 in order to eliminate the Soviet Kursk salient. He intended to conduct a classic pincer attack of the kind that succeeded during the 1942 Kharkov campaign and hoped that the resulting heavy loss of troops and material inflicted on the Red Army would give the Wehrmacht time to recover its strength. Hitler chose two of his best field commanders - Generalfeldmarschall Erich von Manstein and Generaloberst Walter Model - to lead the two pincers against the Kursk salient in Operation Zitadelle. Manstein would attack from the south with Heeresgruppe S�d, while Model attacked from the north with his heavily reinforced AOK 9.</p><p>Model was not in favor of the offensive because he believed the Soviet defenses were too dense, but he dutifully mounted a full-scale offensive from 5 to 10 July 1943. Model's forces included two battalions of the new Ferdinand tank destroyers and a battalion of Tiger tanks, but were only capable of chewing its way through the first line of Soviet defenses. Although Model had failed to accomplish a breakthrough, his forces were far from spent. When the Soviets mounted their own Operation Kutusov to collapse the German-held Orel salient, Model had sufficient forces left to conduct a fighting retreat back to the Hagen Line. By 18 August 18th 1943, the Soviets had liberated Orel and pushed Model's forces back, but suffered over 400,000 casualties and the loss of 2,500 tanks. The Germans had succeeded in gaining a tactical victory that mauled three Soviet tank armies, although the Red Army had achieved an operational-level victory by liberating Orel.</p></p><p>Robert Forczyk has a PhD in International Relations and National Security from the University of Maryland and a strong background in European and Asian military history.

But the country is both geographically and politically challenging, and access from the outside has never been easy. With this book, Clare Harris offers the first historical survey of photography in Tibet and the Himalayas, telling the intriguing stories of both Tibetans and foreigners who have attempted to document the region&#x2019;s wonders on film.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harris combines extensive research in museums and archives with her own fieldwork in Tibetan communities to present materials that have never been examined before&#x2014;including the earliest known photograph taken in Tibet, dating to 1863. She looks at the experimental camera-work of Tibetan monks&#x2014;including the thirteenth Dalai Lama&#x2014;and the creations of contemporary Tibetan photographers and artists. With every image she explores the complex religious, political, and cultural climate in which it was produced. Stunningly illustrated, this book will appeal to anyone interested in the dramatic history of Tibet since the mid-nineteenth century and its unique entanglements with aesthetics and modernity.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Clare Harris </b>is professor of visual anthropology in the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography at the University of Oxford, curator for Asian collections at the Pitt Rivers Museum, and a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. She is the author of several books, including <i>In the Image of Tibet</i>, also published by Reaktion Books.<br> &nbsp;&#x201c;Harris&#x2019;s wonderful <i>Photography and Tibet</i> is part of the Reaktion Books Exposures series, which provides introductions to the history of photography related to specific themes and regions. <i>Photography and Tibet</i> accomplishes this in providing a much-needed introduction to the history of photography in Tibet and surrounding regions of the Himalayas. However, Harris gives us much more, as along with this historical overview, she reveals how the history of photography in Tibet can also be seen as the history of the way Tibet has been imagined beyond its borders by Westerners, Chinese, and others, and how this imagining has directly influenced colonial engagement with Inner Asia and the Himalayas.&#x201d; (<i>Trans Asia Photography Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The narrative is lively and engaging with excellent reference notes, bit it is the many and varied photographs that are the main focus. As the author wryly observes, these often say more about the photographers themselves than they do about their subjects. . . . This is a highly absorbing and important book. It should appeal to the general reader but particularly to those with an interest in Tibetan history and the role of photography as a promoter of truth and artistic ability.&#x201d; (<i>Asian Affairs</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Photography and Tibet</i> brings to the fore a selection of remarkable work presented in an accessible and engaging way. This is an inspiring book from which students and researchers alike will derive great benefit, and one which also has wider resonance for historical geographers working with visual archives in very different contexts.&#x201d; (<i>Journal of Historical Geography</i>)<br><br>"Written in a lively and concise style, the book makes sense of an impressive array of material. . . . This tour de force is deliberately intended for the general reader interested in an up-to-date introduction to the history of the representation and reception of Tibet through photographs taken by both Westerners and Tibetans. The book will nonetheless be of benefit to the scholarly community, since it presents so-far unresearched archive material, raises important issues of colonial history and Western material and visual cultures that the case of Tibet highlights particularly well, and provides reciprocally unprecedented developments on the assimilation of the technology of photography by Tibetans up to this day." (<i>Bulletin of SOAS</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This expansive, intricate, and virtuosic account offers a radical rethinking of photography's relationship with Tibet. Rejecting orientalist narratives of that relationship, Harris addresses the entangled political and cultural dynamics of the medium, from the colonial period to the twenty-first century, through which Tibetan culture has been understood and understands itself.&#x201d; (Elizabeth Edwards, Photographic History Research Centre, De Monfort University)<br><br>&#x201c;A wonderful survey-cum-detective story about the multiple locations of Tibet, and the role of the camera in making them visible.

This a compelling and authoritative account, filled with important new materials and vivid connections, that takes us to the heart of practices caught in the crossfire of different visions of Tibet.&#x201d; (Christopher Pinney, professor of anthropology and visual culture, University College London)</p><h2>Between Earth &amp; Sky: Legends of Native American Sacred Places</h2><p>With grace and drama, Abenaki poet and author Joseph Bruchac retells traditional native legends of ten of America&#x2019;s most awe-inspiring natural landscapes. These wise stories, together with Thomas Locker&#x2019;s luminous paintings, evoke the essential spiritual power of the earth. A full-color map charting the homelands of nearly two hundred North American tribes is included. &#x201c;An excellent choice that will provoke both introspection and discussion.&#x201d;--<i>The Horn Book</i><br></p><p>JOSEPH BRUCHAC is a poet, storyteller, and author of more than sixty books for children and adults who has received many literary honors, including the American Book Award and the PEN Syndicated Fiction Award. He is of Abenaki and Slovak heritage, and lives in Greenfield Center, New York.Grade 3-6?Bruchac frames 11 legends of Native American sacred places with a conversation between Little Turtle and his uncle, Old Bear, who says, " 'There are sacred places all around us...They are found in the East and in the North, in the South and in the West, as well as Above, Below, and the place Within. Without those places we lose our balance.' " Bruchac writes in language that is dignified and almost poetic in its simplicity. The text is printed in stanzas, enhancing the image of prose poems. Each legend is related to one of the seven directions and is attributed to a specific people. There is a brief pronunciation guide and a map showing the general location of different Native American groups, but no other documentation is provided. Glossy, cream-yellow paper; clear, black type with the first letter on each page done in flowing, yet restrained, red calligraphy; and lush art make this a book that is pleasing to the eye. Locker's landscape paintings are done in the tradition of Constable's work, concentrating on conditions of sky, atmosphere, and light rather than physical details. His colors, veering toward the day-glow intensity of Maxfield Parrish's work, infuse the scenes with the intangible presence of the sacred. It is difficult to convey the beliefs of an entire people in one brief legend divorced from the rest of their tradition, yet these selections point to the richness possible in looking at the Earth in a spiritual way.?Karen James, Louisville Free Public Library, KY<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Crisis of German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich</h2><p>In our time two major revolutionary movements - Marxism and National Socialism - have left their mark upon the world. Yet, whereas Marxism is generally recognized as representing an intellectual and ideological tradition extending back for at least a century, National Socialism is not. Rather, to many, the ideological bases of National Socialism were the product of a small group of unbalanced minds. To others, the Nazi ideology was merely a propaganda tactic designed to win support of the masses. still others have found the ideas underlying National Socialism so nebulous and incomprehensible that they have dismissed them as unimportant.<br><br>In fact, though, these ideas are deeply embedded in German history. They were current - indeed, eminently respectable - among several generations of Germans prior to Hitler's rise. Strange, even demonic ideas they were, certainly - racial thought, Germanic Christianity, nature mysticism, sun worship, theosophy - but for many Germans long before the Hitler period they suggested the possibility of political and historical salvation.<br><br>In The Crisis of German Ideology, George L. Mosse traces these currents of thought through nineteenth - and twentieth-century German history, discussing the role they played and the longings they gratifies during nearly a century of German life. He reveals how the anti-liberal and anti-democratic ideology comprising these peculiarly German ideas became institutionalized in the schools, youth movements, veterans' groups, political parties; how the "German revolution" called for by the ideology's exponents was transformed by Hitler into as "anti-Jewish revolution", and how the Nazis fully assimilated these ideas into an effective political program as they rose to power.</p><p></p><h2>MAD - Cover to Cover: 48 Years, 6 Months, &amp; 3 Days of MAD Magazine Covers</h2><p>The covers are presented full-page, on glossy stock, with commentary by Frank Jacobs (author of some 400 articles for the magazine, as well as numerous books).

The early covers, dating from when <i>Mad</i> was a comic book<i>,</i> were done by its first editor, Harvey Kurtzman. Since then, many others have drawn the covers, mocking countless fads, stars, and politicians but always incorporating Norman Mingo's classic rendering of Neuman, "the gap-toothed 'What--Me Worry' idiot kid," in the design. Memorable covers are legion: Mingo's 1961 "upside-down-year" reversible cover; Kurtzman's vast field of orange with a tiny illustration in the upper-left corner, from 1954; and Basil Wolverton's 1954 masterpiece, "Beautiful Girl of the Month," are all grabbers to this day.

Make Room! (1966), the basis for the film Soylent Green.Even after four previous capers on the various planets of Harrison's high-tech (but recognizably hip) 25th century, the freshness of the author's language overcomes a somewhat predictable plot structure to make this outing by his favorite future antihero, Slippery Jim DiGriz, thoroughly entertaining. This installment (following The Stainless Steel Rat Wants You! ) finds the con man/hero under sentence of death by slow-acting poison after he has (almost) robbed an impenetrable Mint. To acquire the antidote he must contract with his natural foe, the military types of the Galactic League. Thus he agrees to retrieve an alien artifact from a prison planet occupied by assorted religious maniacs, TV junkies and Survivalist recluses. What better time, then, to start a rock 'n' roll band? Combing military service files for signs of both combat capacity and musical ability (DiGriz finds they are virtually incompatible) he assembles the Stainless Steel Rats band and proceeds to get himself and his three unlikely commando sidekicks (Steengo, Floyd and Madonette) arrested, sentenced and deported to the prison planet. Once there, the prefab four demonstrate their good humor and hand-to- hand combat abilities encountering the nouveau Vikings, fundamentalist Shepherds, troglodytes and even Feminist Separatists as they race the clock in search of the mysterious artifact. The breakneck pace and DiGriz's offbeat interior monologue keep the plot airborne, and both SF hardcore and mainstream readers should find this an enjoyable adventure. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Life as a Smashed Burrito With Extra Hot Sauce (The Incredible Worlds of Wally McDoogle #1)</h2><p><p>Twelve-year-old Wally - "the walking disaster area" - is forced to stand up to Camp Wahkah Wahkah's number one, all-American bad guy.

Why do the physical events that occur inside a fistful of gelatinous tissue give rise to the world of conscious experience? In <i>The Universe of Consciousness</i> , Gerald Edelman and Giulio Tononi present for the first time a full-scale theory of consciousness based on direct observation of the human brain in action. Their pioneering work, presented here in an elegant style, challenges much of the conventional wisdom about consciousness. <i>The Universe of Consciousness</i> has enormous implications for our understanding of language, thought, emotion, and mental illness.</p><p>Emily Dickinson wrote "The Brain--is wider than the Sky," and who can argue with that? Quoted by Nobel-winning scientist Gerald M. Edelman and his Neurosciences Institute colleague Giulio Tononi in <i>A Universe of Consciousness</i>, Miss Emily neatly explains the problem of conscious awareness, then ducks out of the way as the two scientists get to work solving it. Testable theories of consciousness are mighty lonely, as even the soberest mind can be driven to tears of madness pondering its own activity. Centuries of work by philosophers and psychologists like James and Freud have made little progress by starting with awareness and working backward to the brain; these days we have a secure enough base to try looking in the other direction and building a theory of the mind out of neurons.<p> Though Edelman and Tononi do make a good effort to help out the lay reader, ultimately <i>A Universe of Consciousness</i> is aimed at the interdisciplinary gang of scientists and academics trying to understand our shared but invisible experience. The first sections of the book cover the basic philosophical, psychological, and biological elements essential to their theory. Swiftly the authors proceed to define terms and concepts (even the long-abused term <i>complexity</i> gets a reappraisal) and elaborate on these to create a robust, testable theory of the neural basis of consciousness. Following this hard work, they consider some ramifications of the theory and take a close look at language and thinking. This much-needed jump-start is sure to provoke a flurry of experimental and theoretical responses; <i>A Universe of Consciousness</i> might just help us answer some of the greatest questions of science, philosophy, and even poetry. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><b>Gerald M.

(This "genetic mishap" is traced to a great-grandmother's secret marriage to a pug.) The doting parents bring up squat, jowly, wrinkly-faced Flix to climb trees and eat fried mice and pickled canaries. Under the tutelage of his basset hound godfather, the pup also learns pride in his canine heritage and masters the dog language. Flix's combined talents win him the respect of both communities, the love of a French exchange-student poodle and eventually a career in politics, in which he campaigns to end cat-dog segregation. Ungerer celebrates the versatility and perspective Flix gains from his mixed ancestry while still acknowledging the hardship of not fitting in. His lively illustrations, which feature highly expressive and individualized faces, are more supple and playful than in earlier books. The accomplished artwork brims with funny touches such as a rat-crossing sign in Cattown (speed up!) and a monument to Laika (the first dog to orbit in space) in Dogtown; more pointed details include the no-dogs-allowed sign in a posh Cattown restaurant. Ungerer's return to the field will be welcomed by all who discover this charming addition to his oeuvre, but will be especially appreciated by children growing up in more than one cultural tradition. Ages 6-10. (May) FYI: Tomi Ungerer's The Three Robbers, Moon Man and No Kiss for Mother are being reissued in paperback, as well as Heidi (by Johanna Spyri) in a hardcover edition.

Carrying on beyond Z for zebra, we find letter Yuzz for Yuzz-a-ma-Tuzz, and Glikk as in Glikker, who lives in wild weeds and spends his time juggling with cinnamon seeds! With his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, Dr. Suess has been delighting young children and helping them learn to read for over fifty years. Creator of the wonderfully anarchic Cat in the Hat, and ranked among the UK&#39;s top ten favourite children&#39;s authors, Dr. Seuss is a global best-seller, with nearly half a billion books sold worldwide. As part of a major rebrand programme, HarperCollins is relaunching Dr. Seuss&#39;s best-selling books. In response to consumer demand, bright new cover designs incorporate much-needed guidance on reading levels. The standard paperbacks divide into three reading strands -- Blue Back Books for parents to share with young children, Green Back Books for budding readers to tackle on their own, and Yellow Back Books for older, more fluent readers to enjoy. This is a Yellow Back book.</p><p>A thoroughly Seussian tweak of the alphabet-book tradition, <i>On Beyond Zebra</i> is about all the letters that most people ignore--the ones that come after Z. Our hero (instantly recognizable to most Seuss fans as the boy who captured Thing One and Thing Two in <i>The Cat in the Hat</i>) takes his young friend, Conrad Cornelius O'Donald O'Dell, on a guided tour of all the weird creatures that begin with letters such as <i>Yuzz</i>, <i>Wumbus</i>, and <i>Glikk</i>. "And Nuh is the letter I use to spell Nutches, Who live in small caves, known as Nitches, for hutches." The message is pretty simple: the alphabet pins down boring old "reality," but if you explore further afield there are more interesting worlds to discover. "So, on beyond Z! It's high time you were shown, / That you really don't know all there is to be known." Explorers in need of guidance will even find a table of useful new letters (a <i>beyondabet</i>? a <i>WumbaGlikk</i>?) in the back. (Ages 4 to 8) <i>--Richard Farr</i>lor.

Before him, a rippling ocean stretched out until it disappeared, merging into the clear cobalt sky.<br> <br>The salty fragrance of the sea was overtaken by scents of eucalyptus, myrrh, and hagenia flowers. John smiled. These were always her first embrace! Resisting the urge to jump to his feet, he instead shifted to make room, lowered his head, and took a deep breath. It had been a while.<br> <br>The tall, fine-boned, ebony-black woman accepted his silent invitation and settled next to him, her hand tousling the gray-black hair at the back of his neck with the tenderness of a mother toward her child. The playful touch sent a prickling peace through his shoulders and down his back, lifting the burden he unconsciously carried.<br> <br>He could have stayed like this for some time, but there was always purpose to her visits. Even so, he held off his own rising curiosity, preferring the gentle contentment of her company.<br> <br>Reluctantly, he spoke. &#x201c;Mother Eve?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;John?&#x201d; Without looking, he knew she was grinning. Ancient and powerful, this woman radiated the contagious joy of a child. With one arm she pulled him to her, kissing the top of his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have been in this place . . . ,&#x201d; she began.<br> <br>&#x201c;A hundred years today,&#x201d; he finished. &#x201c;If that is the reason for your visit, I am grateful.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It is in part,&#x201d; Eve said. &#x201c;One hundred years anywhere is cause for celebration.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pulling himself up, he brushed off the sand before helping Eve to her feet. She gracefully accepted his hand, though it wasn&#x2019;t needed. Coarse white hair formed a woven crown around her face, lined and creased by countless years, a masterpiece of sculpted joy and sorrow. She glowed more like a child than a matriarch, her mahogany eyes lit by expectancy.<br> <br>His questions threatened to tumble out in all directions, but she stopped them with a raised hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;John, one good question is worth a thousand answers,&#x201d; she teased. &#x201c;Choose it carefully.&#x201d;<br> <br>It only took a moment to form. &#x201c;How long?&#x201d; he asked somberly. &#x201c;How long must we wait before the end, when our healing will finally be complete?&#x201d; Reaching out, he took her hand and placed it on his heart.<br> <br>&#x201c;Much sooner, John, than when I first asked that same question.&#x201d;<br> <br>He took in a deep breath and nodded, looking into the amber light that flecked her eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;But I am here about today, John. Today, my child will be born into your world.&#x201d;<br> <br>John frowned. &#x201c;Your child? But Mother Eve, are we not each your daughter or your son?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, you are,&#x201d; she declared. &#x201c;But we have long known there would be three in particular who would stand and represent us all. The one to whom was given the promise of the seed, the one whose seed would crush the serpent&#x2019;s head, and the one to whom the seed would be forever united. The Mother, the Daughter, the Bride. The arrival of this girl marks the beginning of the end.&#x201d;<br> <br>So stunned, he hardly noticed Eve pick up a stone and walk toward the water&#x2019;s edge. John followed, disoriented and overwhelmed. She launched the stone high into the air, and they both watched it zip down into the glassy sea with hardly a splash.<br> <br>&#x201c;John,&#x201d; Eve said, &#x201c;in the ocean of the universe, a single stone and ripple changes it forever.&#x201d;<br> <br>John let the small incoming waves tickle his feet and tug at the sand beneath them. To be near Eve was always healing and always disconcerting.<br> <br>A shrill voice sliced the air. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re dawdling, John.&#x201d;<br> <br>He turned. A breeze off the water lifted the hair at the back of his head, even as Eve&#x2019;s perfumes caressed his face.<br> <br>Letty had arrived, and Eve was gone. John sighed.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Scavengers have been calling for you for longer than an hour, and since you are the only Collector within a hundred miles . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Turning back to the water, John selected another smooth stone and threw it high into the air so it would drift on its edge and slice into the water&#x2019;s surface with a satisfying sound. Why such a tiny success always pleased him was a mystery.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s their hurry?&#x201d; he muttered, as Letty arrived at his side. He picked up another stone.<br> <br>She was a bundle of a little old woman, barely three feet tall, with a cane and shawl and mismatched socks folded over mismatched shoes. She looked like an apple that had been left in the hot sun for too long, still round but shriveled up, with piercing black eyes, a crooked nose, and an almost toothless scowl. Her walking stick could have easily passed for a wand of sorts, and it was pointing right at him.<br> <br>When he saw the intensity on her face, he let the rock fall to the sand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Letty?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her words were measured. &#x201c;A large metal container was spotted floating early this morning, hauled ashore, and opened. The Scholars have already ascertained that it drifted here from Earth in real time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s happened before,&#x201d; suggested John.<br> <br>&#x201c;We opened it up and found the remains of twelve human beings, all young females except one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jesus,&#x201d; he mumbled, as much a prayer as an exclamation.<br> <br>&#x201c;The container seems to have been used to transport people great distances, probably on a large vessel or ship. Since no flotsam drifted with it, we surmise it was purposefully jettisoned, but not before the girls inside were executed. If there is any mercy in such a tragedy . . .&#x201d; Her voice hesitated as emotion found its way.<br> <br>John turned and slumped onto the sand, drawing his knees up to his chin. The warmth of the day and gentle breeze now seemed a mockery. Eve&#x2019;s joy had left with her.<br> <br>He felt Letty&#x2019;s tiny hand rest on his shoulder as he fought his rising rage and grief.<br> <br>&#x201c;John, we cannot allow the shadow-sickness to find a place inside our hearts. In this broken cosmos we grieve. We rightly feel fury, but we must not let go of joy&#x2019;s embrace, which is beyond our understanding. To feel all of this means that we are alive.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nodded. &#x201c;You said the humans were female, except one?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, there was also a middle-aged man. The shared initial view is that he may have been trying to protect the girls. There is a story, I&#x2019;m sure, but we might have to wait a long time to hear it fully.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to see&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. The bodies have been transported to the Sanctuary of Sorrows and are being prepared for tomorrow&#x2019;s celebration of fire. Right now, you must do what only you can do . . . so the Scavengers can dismantle and the Artists can find ways to memorialize these precious children.&#x201d;<br> <br>John closed his eyes and turned his face to the sky, wishing his conversation with Eve had not been so unbearably interrupted.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; Letty encouraged. &#x201c;The others are waiting.&#x201d;<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>THE SIZE OF THE container surprised John. At least thirty feet in length, its sheer weight had required a dozen of the Haulers&#x2019; beasts to drag it out of the water over rolling logs. Deep ruts were clearly visible behind the box on the cove&#x2019;s sandy shore. Tents held tables piled high with its contents: clothing, blankets, and a few stuffed toys. It was colder here, as if the sun itself had turned its warming face away.<br> <br>From a pocket he took out a small case, opened it, and slipped a ring on his finger. He then turned the edge so that the impress changed. Anything he touched with this ring would bear a date mark and later be taken to his home, the Refuge, where it would be stored for analysis and reference. From his other pocket he took a pair of thin gloves and pulled them on.<br> <br>The first item that drew his attention was a three-drawer, black, locked file cabinet, which he marked. It was cold to the touch. He waved over a Crafter, a woman with skills for locks and keys, and it took her only a few seconds to open it, leaving John to the contents. It was what he had expected: files of records and information, shipments, and bills of lading, accounting, and various other reports.<br> <br>The bottom drawer held folders documenting the girls&#x2019; scant personal information, including a facial photograph of each. Height, weight, age, health. The names were obviously aliases, each an earthly country beginning with sequential letters of the alphabet: Algeria, Bolivia, Canada, and down to Lebanon. He paused for a moment to stare at the images. The faces and eyes in the photos were windows into twelve stories that deserved a proper grieving.<br> <br>John was about to shut the drawer and move on when a thought crossed his mind. He counted the folders. Twelve, just as Letty had said. But that was wrong. Her number had included the man. He counted again. Twelve photos, all girls, all young. It meant a girl was missing. Perhaps she had escaped or the records were inaccurate, but the discrepancy nagged at the edges of his thinking and wouldn&#x2019;t let him go.<br> <br>Had Eve been referring to one of these?<br> <br>On a hunch he walked a few feet over to the container itself. A row of boots for the workers was lined up near the doors, protective footwear that would later be thoroughly cleaned and decontaminated. He picked a pair his size.<br> <br>An Engineer greeted him, &#x201c;Hey, John. Terrible tragedy, all this.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nodded as he laced up his boots. &#x201c;I want to go inside for just a moment and check something against these records. Anything I should know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, there are still odds and ends to go through, but we&#x2019;ve already removed what&#x2019;s most important.&#x201d;<br> <br>John nodded sadly, acknowledging the man&#x2019;s kindness.<br> <br>&#x201c;Also, we just turned off the refrigeration unit. It&#x2019;s still freezing in there. Probably got damaged and stuck in the cold cycle, which was a blessing I suppose. The bodies were almost frozen. Be careful, it&#x2019;s pretty slick.&#x201d;<br> <br>The doors opened easily, groaning on their hinges, letting the sunlight spill inward. Internal lighting flickered on, indicating some sort of closed battery system separate from the refrigeration. He realized as he stepped in that he had been holding his breath. When he let it go through gritted teeth, his exhaling vapor drifted up and around him.<br> <br>The hold was about a third full of larger items&#x2014;boxes, mats, plastic containers&#x2014;along with litter and bits and pieces of trash, a hodgepodge he would have to go through at some point. Frozen bloodstains were scattered around the metallic tomb, the walls, the floor. Carefully, he stepped around these, every sound he made reverberating in the stillness.<br> <br>At the far end he could see the refrigeration fan now silent and unmoving, a thin layer of ice already forming on the blades. A quick survey almost satisfied him that there was no place left that could hide a missing girl.<br> <br>But an anomaly caught his eye. At the end of the wall near the cooling unit was a welded metallic frame jutting out about a foot and a half. He cautiously made his way back and examined it closely. Under the bottom were hinges, and when he ran his fingers along the top, he found two large clamps. John knew that if he undid them, the entire thing would open down and out. A sleeping area, like a bunk or tabletop perhaps? Maybe for a guard?<br> <br>He hesitated. Then he blew on his hands and unsnapped the clasps, which released with a hollow clack. As he lowered the metal wall, the frosted steel bit into his palms and fingers through the thin gloves. It was heavy and he had to use a shoulder to let it down until chains at either end unraveled their lengths. It stopped a couple feet from the floor, level and sturdy. That is where he found her.<br> <br>The teenaged girl was broken inside this space. Someone had forced it shut and she had not fit. She could have been peacefully asleep, her limbs at odd angles, her head folded down on her chest, were it not for the cuts and gashes that began to ooze with the release of pressure. One foot was almost severed. As she lay there frozen, he stood staring, stuck in time.<br> <br>John turned and walked out, too sickened to avoid the blood this time. He needed to fetch those trained to deal with such things.<br> <br>&#x201c;I found another girl!&#x201d; he yelled, setting off a flurry of activity that rushed past him and into the container. Outside, he unlaced the boots and took them off, walked back to the tent where he had marked the cabinet, sat down, and leaned against it.<br> <br>&#x201c;God, how is it that You still love us?&#x201d; he whispered. He paused and glanced in the direction of the container. &#x201c;Please, grant to her Your peace,&#x201d; he prayed.<br> <br>Another explosion of activity and shouting brought him to his feet. A Hauler friend burst into the tent and hugged him.<br> <br>&#x201c;John! That girl you found! She is still alive! Barely, but alive!&#x201d; The man beamed and hugged him a second time. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a Finder now, John!&#x201d; the Hauler yelled as he left. &#x201c;Who would have imagined?&#x201d;<br> <br>John dropped his head into his hands, feeling numb. If this was Eve&#x2019;s child, it was a sorrowful and wrenching birth, in blood and water. What good could come of such evil?</p><h2>Beneath Nightmare Castle (Fighting Fantasy No. 25, Presented by Steve Jackson &amp; Ian Livingstone)</h2><p>vg+ condition 1st edition Adventure Fighting Fantasy game book</p><p></p><h2>Alcatraz #2: Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener&#39;s Bones</h2><p>The Evil Librarians are up to their antics again!<br><br>Alcatraz Smedry has an incredible talent . . . for breaking things!

Fortunately for the fans of <i>Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians</i> (Scholastic, 2007), these are all good things. On the run from a Scrivener's Bone, a half-human, half-machine assassin that has been sent to retrieve the Translator's Lenses that Alcatraz stole in the first book, the boy receives word that his father is in mortal danger in the Library of Alexandria. He and a crew of quirky relatives with odd but very useful Talents mount a daring and completely ludicrous rescue. Though some readers may find the author's non sequiturs and frequent interruptions in the narrative off-putting, those who enjoy their fantasy with a healthy dose of slapstick humor will be delighted. Give this novel to fans of Eoin Colfer's "Artemis Fowl" (Hyperion/Miramax) and Catherine Jinks's Cadel Piggott in <i>Evil Genius</i> (Harcourt, 2007). They will appreciate Sanderson's cheerful sarcastic wit and none-too-subtle digs at librarians.&#x2014;<i>Jane Henriksen Baird, Anchorage Public Library, AK</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Levine's series heroine Jaine Austen (<i>Death by Pantyhose</i>, etc.) spots a wealthy suburbanite's killer in the unfortunately skimpy The Danger of Candy Canes, where the subplot about a troubled teen is more compelling than the actual mystery. Hannah Swensen (<i>Key Lime Pie Murder</i>, etc.) experiments with new Christmas cookies (recipes included, of course) and gets to the bottom of a Santa slaying in Fluke's complex Candy Cane Murder, which includes several plausible suspects and a surprising twist-an impressive feat in just 150 pages. Meier's powerful Candy Canes of Christmas Past takes heroine Lucy Stone (<i>Bake Sale Murder</i>, etc.) back to December 1983, when, newly arrived in Tinker's Cove, Maine, she found herself investigating the circumstances of a decades-old local death and struggling with her own financial and domestic difficulties. Fluke and Meier ably make up for Levine's shortcomings to create a sweet holiday treat for mystery lovers. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Not only because of the defendant, Maggie Bradford, the woman whose songs captivated the world&#39;s heart. Not only because of the victim, Will Shepard, the world&#39;s most glamorous athlete.

And because in Maggie&#39;s world - the world she feared and despised but could not escape, the world of the powerful, the rich, and the ruthless - both death and life could never be what they seemed. From James Patterson, bestselling author of KISS THE GIRLS and ALONG CAME A SPIDER, comes his most brilliantly realized thriller, a story that will shatter your expectations...and hold every last one of your nerves in thrall, with each twist of the plot and every turn of the page.</p><p>James Patterson has had more <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers than any other writer, ever, according to <i>Guinness World Records</i>. Since his first novel won the Edgar Award in 1977 James Patterson's books have sold more than 300 million copies. He is the author of the Alex Cross novels<b>,</b> the most popular detective series of the past twenty-five years, including <i>Kiss the Girls </i>and <i>Along Came a Spider</i>. He writes full-time and lives in Florida with his family.<br>If Thomas Harris's psycho-thrillers are the creme de la creme of the genre, then Patterson's (Kiss the Girls; Along Came a Spider) are the skimmed milk?fluid, but low in substance. In his new novel, the author again lays down a narrative line so gripping?an effect achieved partly through a plethora of one-sentence paragraphs, a la Sidney Sheldon?that the reader may not notice, or care, that characterization and originality have fallen by the wayside. Patterson tells his story through two points of view: there's the the first-person voice of Maggie Bradford, who kills her abusive husband in the novel's flashback prologue and has now become a world-famous singer-songwriter ("I love your music, Maggie," Barbra Streisand tells her); and there's a third-person narration that is often filtered through the eyes of Will Shepherd, the celebrated soccer star who romances Maggie after her interim lover, an older tycoon, dies of a heart attack. The devastatingly handsome Will likes to hurt women ("there was a distinctly good part in him, but also a bad part"), however, and sometimes even to kill them. Will seems to want Maggie to save him from himself. Using his beauty and charm on her and her children, he wins her hand in marriage. That union sets up a major-league deja vu, two murder trials that aren't quite riveting and a final Big Twist that will only surprise those fresh to the thriller genre. Still, Will's descent into cartoonishness, and various loose threads, will probably not bother readers swept along by this lightweight pop fiction. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lammas Night</h2><p>What Magic Can Stop Adolf Hitler -- History's Most Evil Black Magician?<br><br>Modern War<br><br>The year is 1940.

You been sitting on your arse for three weeks, or have you been poking around like I asked?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Poking around, Sarge.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You can cover a lot of ground in that time.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sarge.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I told you, didn&#x2019;t I, no dropkicks?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Loud and clear, Sarge.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No dropkicks on my watch,&#x201d; Sergeant Kropp said, &#x201c;and no smartarses.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He switched gears, telling Hirsch that a woman motorist had called it in. &#x201c;No name mentioned, on her way to view the wildflowers, heard shots when she pulled over to photograph the Tin Hut.&#x201d; Kropp paused. &#x201c;You with me, the Tin Hut?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch didn&#x2019;t have a clue. &#x201c;Sarge.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So get your arse out there, let me know what you find.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Sarge.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Could be someone&#x2019;s idea of a joke,&#x201d; the sergeant said, &#x201c;and this is farming country, the sheep-shaggers like to take pot-shots at rabbits, but you never know.&#x201d;<br><br>Wheat and wool country, in fact, three hours north of Adelaide, Hirsch&#x2019;s new posting a single-officer police station in a blink-and-you&#x2019;d-miss-it town on the Barrier Highway. There were still a few of these little cop shops around the state, the Department knowing not to call them one-man stations, not in this day and age, or not in print or in range of a microphone, but it didn&#x2019;t place female officers in them all the same, citing<br>safety and operational concerns. So, single guys were sent to Tiverton (the wives of married officers would take one look and say no thanks)&#x2014;often, or especially, guys with a stink clinging to them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like Hirsch.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The police station was the front room of a small brick house right on the highway, where flies droned and sluggish winds stirred the dusty community notices. Hirsch lived in the three rooms behind it: bathroom, sitting room with alcove kitchen, bedroom. He also enjoyed a parched front lawn, a narrow driveway for his own aged Nissan and the SA Police fleet vehicle, a four-wheel-drive Toyota Hi Lux mounted with a rear cage, and a storeroom at the back, its barred window and reinforced door dating from pre- death-in-custody days, when it had been the lockup. And for all of these bounties the Department screwed him on the rent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finishing the call with Sergeant Kropp, Hirsch located Bitter Wash Road on the wall map, locked up, pinned his mobile number to the front door and backed out of the driveway. He passed the general store first, just along from the police station and opposite the primary school, the playground still and silent, the kids on holiday, then a couple of old stone houses, the Institute with its weathered cannon and memorial to the dead of the world wars, more houses, two churches, an agricultural supplier, a signposted grain dealer down a side street . . . and that was Tiverton. No bank, chemist, medical practice, lawyer, dentist, accountant or high school.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He drove south along the floor of a shallow valley, undulating and partly cultivated hills on his left, a more dramatic and distant range on his right&#x2014;blue today, scarred here and there by scrubby trees and shadows among erupted rocks, a foretaste of the Flinders Ranges, three hours further north. In the fashion of the locals, Hirsch lifted one finger from the steering wheel to greet the oncoming cars, all two of them. Nothing else<br>moved. He was travelling through a land poised for movement: birds watched him from the power lines as if snipped from tin, farmhouses crouched mutely behind cypress hedges, and farm vehicles sat immobile in paddocks, waiting for him to pass.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Five kilometres south of Tiverton he turned left at the Bitter Wash turnoff, heading east into the hills, and here there was some movement in the world. Stones smacked the chassis. Skinny sheep fled, a dog snarled at a fence line, crows rose untidily from a flattened sleepy lizard. The road turned and rose and fell, taking him deeper into pretty but hardscrabble country, just inside the rain shadow. He passed a tumbled stone wall dating from the 1880s, a couple of massive perfect gumtrees, a wind farm turbine. Someone had been planting trees up and down one of the gullies, to combat erosion. Then Hirsch remembered to check kilometres travelled since the turnoff, and wondered when he&#x2019;d come upon the hut his sergeant was talking about.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He slowed for a dip in the road, water running shallowly across it from last night&#x2019;s storm, and accelerated uphill, over a peak and around a blind corner and jammed on the brakes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gumtree branch the length of a power pole lay across Bitter Wash Road. Hirsch switched off, his heart hammering. Close shave. Beyond the obstacle the road dipped again, bottoming out where a creek in weak, muddy flood had scored a shallow trench in the gravel, then it climbed to another blind corner. And in a little cleared area inside the fence and alongside the creek, was Sergeant Kropp&#x2019;s Tin Hut: corrugated iron walls and roof, mostly rust colored, and a crooked chimney. On a flat above it he glimpsed trees and the suggestion of a green farmhouse roof.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch got out. He was reaching to drag the branch off the road when a bullet snapped past his head.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His first and natural instinct was to duck, his second to scuttle around to the lee side of the Hi Lux, drawing his service pistol, a S&amp;W 40 calibre semi-automatic. His first <i>thought</i> was that Kropp&#x2019;s anonymous caller had got it right. But then, crouched<br>there beside the grubby rear wheel, Hirsch began to have a second thought: two days earlier, some arsehole had placed a pistol cartridge in his letterbox, and it occurred to him now that it hadn&#x2019;t been a joke or a threat but a promise. He weighed his options: call for backup; tackle the shooter; get the hell out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the choice had been made for him. The cunts had trapped him where the road dipped between a canola crop and a stony hill. As soon as he showed himself&#x2014;as soon as he got behind the wheel or clambered uphill to find the shooter or climbed the fence to run through the canola&#x2014;he&#x2019;d be shot. Meanwhile, police backup was in Redruth, forty kilometres away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch&#x2019;s mind stopped racing and settled on one thought: the shooters were the very officers he hoped might back him up. They were not forty kilometres but forty metres away, up there on the hillside, positioned for a crossfire, their radios conveniently switched off. Redruth was a three-man station, Kropp and two constables, and when Hirsch had called in to introduce himself, three weeks ago, they&#x2019;d called him a dog, a maggot. They&#x2019;d mouthed <i>pow!</i> as they finger-shot their temples, grinned<br>as they finger-sliced their throats.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Placed a pistol cartridge in his letterbox when his back was turned.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch thought about it some more. Even if he managed to climb inside the Hi Lux again, the tree was still across the road, there was nowhere to turn around and they&#x2019;d shoot him through the glass. Discounting a full-on, up-hill assault, that left a zigzagging escape into the canola crop, a broad yellow swathe stretching to the smoky hills on the other side of the valley&#x2014;but to reach it he&#x2019;d first have to climb the bank and then tangle himself in a wire fence, and how much cover would the crop provide?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch began to feel jittery, a strange discordancy of his<br>senses. He might have put it down to fear, but it was more a kind of illness. Some emanation from the wind farm? He was very close to one of the turbines. It sat on the stony hill where the shooter was hiding, the first of a ragged line stretching along this side of the valley, and the blades were cutting the air in a steady, rhythmic whooshing that reached deep in his guts. To Hirsch, it was all of a piece with ending his days where the world was unlovely, at the base of a scruffy slope of grass tussocks, rabbit<br>holes and licheny stone reefs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced both ways along the road. He didn&#x2019;t know where the next farmhouses were or how much traffic to expect, or . . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christ, traffic. Hirsch cocked an ear, listening for vehicles he&#x2019;d have to warn off, or protect, or mop the collateral blood from. Or fear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which raised the question: Why would the bastards ambush him here, within cooee of town? Why not somewhere more remote, like &#x201c;out east&#x201d;&#x2014;as the locals called it. According to the calendar hanging above Hirsch&#x2019;s desk, &#x201c;out east&#x201d; was a region of undernourished mallee scrub, red dirt, nude stone chimneys, mine shafts, rock art, September wildflowers and one jagged hill named the Razorback.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; September school holidays, wildflowers blooming . . . Hirsch listened again, imagining he could hear a busload of tourists trundling along Bitter Wash Road.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He risked a quick glance over the passenger door windowsill. The radio handset jutted from a cradle on the dashboard. His phone, a Motorola Defy, sat in a drinks holder between the front seats. He wasn&#x2019;t obliged to call the Redruth station. He could call Peterborough, Clare, even Adelaide . . .<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next shot came.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch froze, fingers on the door handle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he relaxed minutely. He analysed what it was he&#x2019;d heard. Not a high-powered crack but something flat, puny, small calibre, dampened further by the huge sky above and the whoosh of the turbine blades. Hardly what you&#x2019;d expect of a sniping rifle, and it had been accompanied by a weak howl as the bullet hit an obstacle&#x2014;a stone?&#x2014;and whanged away across the creek.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowhere near him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A <i>second</i> ricochet came. He stiffened again, relaxed again. Not a ricochet, nor an echo, but a young voice saying <i>peeowww. </i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch did what he should have done from the start and eyed the fallen branch. No drag marks in the gravel, no saw or axe cuts, excess foliage still intact. He eyed the tree itself. The wound was half way up the trunk, and he recalled camping trips from his childhood, the teachers warning the kids not to pitch their tents under gum trees. All that sinewy health on the outside and quiet decay within.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the police.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He holstered his handgun and, hunching his shoulders a little, stepped into the middle of the road and dragged the branch into the ditch. Then he parked the Hi Lux on a narrow verge, leaving room for passing vehicles, and climbed the scabby hill to see who might have put him in his grave if his luck hadn&#x2019;t been running.<br><br>They didn&#x2019;t hear his approach, the boy and the girl: the<br>wind, the rhythmic rush of the turbine above their heads, their<br>absolute absorption as one kid aimed a .22 at a jam tin on a rock<br>and the other stood by to watch.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch knew he should pounce on them before they sent another ricochet over the road, but he paused. The view from the base of the turbine was panoramic, exhilarating, and Bitter Wash Road was clear in both directions, so he took a moment to get his bearings. The broad valley, the vigorous crops, the road running up and down the folds in the earth. And that khaki smudge back there was Tiverton with its pale grain silos poking into the haze.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a farmhouse above the Tin Hut, the green roof clearly visible now, and on the other side of the road was a redroofed house. Trees and cypresses hedged them in, shrubberies and garden beds and lawns, the usual landscaping out here in the wheat and wool country, but the green-roofed property was extensive, with a number of sheds, a set of stockyards and farm vehicles parked on a dirt clearing beside a haystack, while the red roof was small, faded, boasting only an attached carport and one small garden shed. Hirsch wondered at the relationship between the two properties. Maybe a farm manager lived in the smaller house. Or a &#x201c;couple&#x2019;, a man to do the gardening, his<br>wife to cook and clean. The shit work. Or maybe those feudal relationships no longer existed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirsch shaded his eyes. The sun passed in and out of the scrappy clouds, a crow sideslipped above the road, sparrowhawks hunted above the creek, sheep trotted nose to tail along a dirt pad on a nearby hillside.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise only the children moved, and Hirsch was betting they belonged to one or both of the houses. No school for two weeks, and, with the blessing or ignorance of their parents, they&#x2019;d taken a .22 rifle out for some target shooting. The location was perfect: nothing here but grass and stones, sloping down to the creek, nothing with blood in its veins, yet you could pretend you were in a shootout with the bad guys, and when the rifle grew too heavy for your little arms you could prop the barrel on a rock.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except that bullets strike objects and howl off in unexpected directions. Or you might forget where you are and take a pot-shot at a crow or a rabbit just when a policeman is stepping out of his Hi Lux to shift a fallen tree.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, well, wasn&#x2019;t this just great? A couple of adults he could deal with: clear regulations, clear offences and penalties. But kids . . . He&#x2019;d have to involve the parents; he&#x2019;d maybe have to charge the parents. Hell to pay.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children didn&#x2019;t hear him, not at first, not until, side-stepping down the slope, he skidded and fell. Now they heard him, his curses and the tock and rattle of stones tumbling over one another, Hirsch cursing because he&#x2019;d frightened himself, torn his trousers and barked the skin on palm and elbow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children whirled around in shared alarm, mouths open, eyes shocked. They were caught in the act, and they knew it, but it was how they managed it that mattered, and Hirsch, forgetting his discomfort, was intrigued to see divergent reactions. The boy dropped his eyes l...</p><h2>Ready for Dessert: My Best Recipes</h2><p>Pastry chef David Lebovitz is known for creating desserts with bold and high-impact flavor, not fussy, complicated presentations.

And as the tanager woos a mate and begins to build a nest, Dvor�k writes the bird&#x2019;s music down on everything from paper to shirtsleeves. At the end of one long summer evening, the scarlet tanager hears familiar music from the town&#x2019;s schoolhouse and settles on a branch nearby to listen. Inside, Dvor�k and his friends play the first rehearsal of &#x201c;American Quartet,&#x201d; inspired by the little songbird.

This is her first book for children.<br>Gr 1-4-In the author's terms, "historical fact and imagination are woven together" to describe how the famous Czech composer heard the song of the scarlet tanager while summering in Iowa in 1893 and was inspired to write the third movement of the American Quartet, a string quartet in F major. The story eloquently captures the essence of listening and skillfully demonstrates the patience and dedication Dvor&nbsp;k shows in trying to hear the bird's song and to re-create the melody with musical instruments. As the composer works, the bird is equally busy, finding a mate and building a nest. Gorgeously colored illustrations complement the subject matter. The red bird is always visible, even amid bright blues, greens, and yellows. The artist uses thickly applied oils in vibrant swirls to create van Goghesque paintings that seem to have rhythm and movement of their own. An author's note provides historical background.

And I continued to devour this wonderful series: THE QUESTION OF MAX, DEATH IN A TENURED POSITION, NO WORD FROM WINIFRED -- and onward. In time, I (and many other readers) came to realize that "Amanda Cross" is a pseudonym for Dr. Carolyn G. Heilbrun, the revered Columbia University professor whose WRITING A WOMAN'S LIFE and other nonfiction volumes are recognized as ground-breaking classics in literary criticism and feminist studies. My admiration for the author grew and grew -- in both her guises. And then a few years ago, I had the great good fortune to become the editor of her "Amanda Cross" half. Which has given me many opportunities to get to know Carolyn personally (it helps that we live only a few blocks from each other). So I've been in the company of this widely beloved author for autograph parties, bookstore events, an honorary dinner, and recently at the ALA (American Library Association) conference, where scores of adoring fans -- librarians and educators -- patiently queued up to get personally autographed copies of THE PUZZLED HEART, the latest Fansler mystery, as well as backlist titles in the series. Even with the resultant writer's cramp, it was a great day for "Amanda." And another cherished memory I have of this charming, gracious, and multitalented author.<br><br>--Joe Blades, Associate Publisher</p><h2>Baltimore Catechism No. 3</h2><p>Since the Baltimore Catechism was first launched in 1885, it has proved an incomparable tool for passing on the faith to the next generation.

The Baltimore Catechism clearly and concisely explains what Catholics believe. The question and answer format is useful for anyone who wants to grow in his or her knowledge of the faith of the Catholic Church. It is also perfect for parents who want to instruct their children in the fundamentals of Catholicism.

According to eminent theologian J.I. Packer, however, Christians have become enchanted by modern skepticism and have joined the "gigantic conspiracy of misdirection" by failing to put first things first. <i>Knowing God</i> aims to redirect our attention to the simple, deep truth that to know God is to love His Word. What began as a number of consecutive articles angled for "honest, no-nonsense readers who were fed up with facile Christian verbiage" in 1973, <i>Knowing God</i> has become a contemporary classic by creating "small studies out of great subjects." Each chapter is so specific in focus (covering topics such as the trinity, election, God's wrath, and God's sovereignty), that each succeeding chapter's theology seems to rival the next, until one's mind is so expanded that one's entire view of God has changed. Author Elizabeth Eliot wrote that amid the lofty content Packer "puts the hay where the sheep can reach it--plainly shows us ordinary folks what it means to know God." Having rescued us from the individual hunches of our ultra-tolerant theological age, Packer points the reader to the true character of God with his theological competence and compassionate heart. The lazy and faint-hearted should be warned about this timeless work--God is magnified, the sinner is humbled, and the saint encouraged. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>Beautifully designed in quality bonded leather, each God&#39;s Light gift book gives God&#39;s Word on one of life&#39;s most important topics.

His determination to create books for children led to a BFA from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York, and an MFA from the California College of Arts &amp; Crafts in Oakland, California.&nbsp; <p>His particular way with color, line, detail, and design have earned him many of the most prestigious awards in his field, among them a Caldecott Honor Award for&nbsp;<i>Strega Nona</i>, the Smithsonian Medal, the Kerlan Award from the University of Minnesota for his "singular attainment in children's literature," the Catholic Library Association's Regina Medal for his "continued distinguished contribution," and the University of Southern Mississippi Medallion. He was also the 1990 United States nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration, and received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award for lifetime contribution to children's literature in 2011.</p> <p>DePaola has published almost 200 children's books in&nbsp;15 different countries over the past 30 years.&nbsp;Among his most well-known titles are the <i>Strega Nona </i>series, <i>26 Fairmount Avenue</i>, and <i>The Legend of the Indian Paintbrush.</i></p> <p>DePaola lives in an interesting house in New Hampshire with his four dogs. His studio is in a large renovated 200-year-old barn.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3-In this folktale variant, lovely Adelita gains a family when her father remarries. Following the traditional story line, Dona Micaela and her daughters, Valentina and Dulce, are utterly impossible, but all is well as long as Adelita's father is alive. However, when he dies, she is relegated to helping in the kitchen. Eventually, Dona Micaela evicts old Esperanza, and her stepdaughter is left to do all the work. On the night of the fiesta at the Gordillos' hacienda, it is Esperanza who takes the fairy godmother role, sends Adelita to the party, and sees to it that young Javier is smitten. True to form, he locates the young woman when she flees, and they marry. The prose is straightforward and crisp, though the habit of including a Spanish phrase that is translated immediately afterward (e.g., "Soy yo-only me-" or "-mi peque-ita-my little one-") interrupts the narrative flow. However, this is a minor quibble given the beauty of dePaola's signature artwork. Making perfect use of clear, warm hues, the full-color acrylic illustrations are a feast for the eye. Depth and brilliance in composition combine with economy of line and form to create a true tour de force. Use this with either Robert D. San Souci's Little Gold Star (HarperCollins, 2000) or Joe Hayes's Little Gold Star/Estrellita de oro (Cinco Puntos, 2000) for different looks at "Cinderella" through Mexican eyes.<br><i>Ann Welton, Grant Elementary School, Tacoma, WA</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Devil and Sonny Liston</h2><p>A biography of the controversial fighter follows Liston from the mean streets, where he was a petty criminal, to the heavyweight championship and his life as a pawn of organized crime. By the author of Power on Earth. Reprint. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Nick Tosches was born in Newark and schooled in his father&#39;s Jersey City bar. He is the author of Dino, an acclaimed biography of Dean Martin, among other books. He is a contributing editor of Vanity Fair.Tosches has always been drawn to the lives of dark and mysteriously flawed or fallen public figures--Jerry Lee Lewis in Hellfire, Dean Martin in Dino--and in one-time heavyweight champ Charles "Sonny" Liston he has found his biggest and darkest figure yet. Born in abject poverty in eastern Arkansas, Liston grew up to be a quiet, inarticulate youth who, after moving with his mother to St. Louis, put his only talent to work: intimidation. Knocking over gas stations and grocery stores, he ended up in a penitentiary doing eight years. His brawny build and huge hands made him an invincible force in the prison boxing program, which earned him an early release but delivered him into an enslavement from which he never escaped. Tosches marshals prodigious research to prove that, early on, Liston became captive to organized crime at a time when boxing was ruled by a mob syndicate. This is a very sad tale of an illiterate man who became useful to figures who had their own agenda: making money. Tosches finds people close to Liston who claim the fighter told them that his first bout with the man then known as Cassius Clay was fixed (with the mob taking down $2.1 million by betting on the 7-to-1 underdog); others strongly imply that the outcome of the second fight--that of the infamous "phantom punch"--in Lewiston, Maine, was also a foregone conclusion. Events around the beleaguered and bewildered Liston whirl at dizzying speeds--the Kefauver investigation of boxing, the war in Vietnam, the rise of the Nation of Islam, the cultural roar of the 1960s generation--and Tosches is a master at keeping his finger on the pulse of the period and his eye on the pitiable Sonny. Throughout, though, what is most remarkable is Tosches's empathy for the fighter derided as "a bear," a "hoodlum" and, by the loquacious Ali, as simply "ugly." In Tosches's hands, Liston is an unfortunate victim of people much worse than he, and the boxer emerges with a kind of mute dignity: this man "who neither knew his age nor felt any ties of blood upon this earth nor saw any future knew only that he was nobody and that he had come from nowhere and that he was nowhere." In a prose style that runs like a hot improvisational jazz riff, Tosches makes a somebody of a nobody, and along the way brings more than a few reputations down a good notch.

On a couple of occasions, he spots the old man being hustled in and out of the precinct house, doing his best to ignore the shouted questions of the newshounds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By midweek, his meager provisions, the stuff he removed from their icebox, have run out. He will have to risk a trip outside for some food. Luckily, the scratches on his face have begun to fade. She had mauled him like nobody&#x2019;s business. Put up a hell of a fight. Must have taken her twenty minutes to die.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waits until nightfall, then slips downstairs and out the front door. After a hasty bite at an all-night cafeteria, he returns to his room with a sackful of groceries and the final editions of the Mirror, the Journal, and the News.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The papers are full of the story: &#x201c;The Mystery of the Slain Artist&#x2019;s Model,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Easter Sunday Murders,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Beekman Place Massacre.&#x201d; Not one fails to mention its &#x201c;curious parallels&#x201d; to the Titterton killing during Holy Week a year before. Or to the Stretz case of 1935, also in the ritzy neighborhood of Beekman Place.1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He counts more than twenty photographs of Ronnie in the tabloids, most in cheesecake poses, her nakedness barely concealed by a gauzy, airbrushed veil. By contrast, he finds only a couple of Ethel, bundled in a fur coat, her face drawn, her frowning husband beside her. The grainy pictures do nothing to capture her perfection.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is sorry to have caused Ethel grief. If she had been home that night, none of this would have happened. Otherwise, he feels not a twinge of remorse. Why should he? They aren&#x2019;t really dead. Sure, they might be gone from this plane. But their lives aren&#x2019;t lost. You can&#x2019;t destroy one atom of matter. How are you going to destroy spirit?2<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reads about the growing list of suspects&#x2014;Ronnie&#x2019;s countless boyfriends, Mary&#x2019;s former boarders, the Englishman&#x2019;s shady acquaintances. Every cop in the city is on the lookout for the &#x201c;mad slayer.&#x201d; And all the while, he is right under their noses, holed up just a block away. He has made absolutely no effort to cover his tracks. Must have left dozens of fingerprints all over the apartment. Didn&#x2019;t even bother to go back for the glove when he realized he&#x2019;d left it behind. The incompetence of the police and their supposed scientific experts amuses him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, he knows it is only a matter of time before his name comes up. By the end of the week, he decides to skip town. Someday, when he has made his great contribution to the human race, he will be able to travel just by visualization. Time and space will mean nothing. For now, he will have to rely on more prosaic means.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, April 4, exactly one week after the Easter morning slaughter, Robert Irwin boards a train to Philadelphia.</i> &nbsp; <b><i>Part I<br></i>Beekman Place</b> <b></b><br><b>1<br>Dead End<br></b> Beekman Place&#x2014;a tranquil East Side enclave just north of the United Nations and one of Manhattan&#x2019;s most exclusive addresses&#x2014;hasn&#x2019;t always been home to the rich. Its name derives from the Beekman family, whose American branch dates back to 1647, when the wealthy Dutch merchant Wilhelmus Beekman arrived in the New World on the same ship carrying Peter Stuyvesant. In 1763, his descendant James Beekman built a stately country home on the high bank of the East River at what is now 51st Street. Furnished with costly imports and the handiwork of the finest colonial craftsmen, Mount Pleasant (as the picturesque white mansion was named) was commandeered by the British during the Revolutionary War and used as their military headquarters. The patriot-spy Nathan Hale was tried there for treason in September 1776 and held overnight in the greenhouse before being hanged the next morning in a nearby orchard. Following the war, George and Martha Washington are said to have paid frequent visits to Mount Pleasant, where &#x201c;Mrs. Beekman would refresh them with lemonade made from fruit which she gathered from her famous lemon trees.&#x201d;1<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abandoned by the Beekman family in 1854 when a cholera epidemic drove them from the city, the venerable mansion stood for another twenty years. By the time of its demolition in 1874, the once-bucolic area had been transformed into a stretch of stolid middle-class row houses, bordered by a shorefront wasteland of coal yards, breweries, and so many cattle pens, tanneries, and meatpacking plants that the neighborhood just to the south was known as Blood Alley.2 Following an evening stroll around Beekman Place in 1871, the diarist George Templeton Strong wryly noted its &#x201c;nice outlook over the East River,&#x201d; which included &#x201c;a clear view of the penitentiary, the smallpox hospital, and the other palaces of Blackwell&#x2019;s Island.&#x201d;3<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the following decades, the neighborhood continued to decline. As waves of European immigrants poured into the city and surged northward from the teeming ghettos of the Lower East Side, Beekman Place became engulfed by slums, its aging brownstones reduced to cheap boardinghouses for the foreign-born workers eking out a living at the waterside factories and abattoirs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its rehabilitation began in the 1920s when the East Side riverfront was colonized by Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, and other adventurous blue bloods. The old brownstones were renovated into stylish town houses, while several elegant apartment buildings, designed by some of the era&#x2019;s leading architects, arose on the site. One of the most impressive structures was the twenty-six-story Art Deco skyscraper at the corner of East 49th Street and First Avenue. Intended as a club and dormitory for college sorority women, it was originally known as the Panhellenic House but was renamed the Beekman Tower when it became a residential hotel for both sexes in 1934.4 By then, the now-fashionable neighborhood was home to a particularly rich concentration of artists, writers, and theatrical celebrities, among them Katharine Cornell, Ethel Barrymore, and Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. In later years, the neighborhood would boast such residents as Irving Berlin, Greta Garbo, and No�l Coward.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Beekman Place and its even swankier neighbor, Sutton Place, were undergoing their revival, however, the surrounding streets remained untouched by gentrification. In the early 1930s, the area was a glaring study in contrasts, a neighborhood where luxury towers soared amid grimy tenements, where frayed laundry hung on lines within sight of private gardens, and where young toughs frolicked in the river beside the yachts and motor launches of the superrich.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October 1935, New York theatergoers got a vivid look at this &#x201c;strange otherworld&#x201d; when the socially conscious crime drama <i>Dead End</i> opened on Broadway. Written by Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winner Sidney Kingsley (and later adapted for the screen by Lillian Hellman), the play concerns a poor aspiring young architect named Gimpty, hopelessly in love with a beautiful society girl; a vicious gangster named Baby-face Martin, drawn back to the old neighborhood by vestigial stirrings of human sentiment; and a gang of adolescent wharf rats seemingly doomed to criminal lives of their own. Its setting, inspired by the dock off 53rd Street just north of Beekman Place, is described in stage directions that perfectly capture the jarring contrasts that characterized the area in the mid-1930s: <br>dead end of a New York street, ending in a wharf over the East River. To the left is a high terrace and a white iron gate leading to the back of the exclusive East River Terrace Apartments. Hugging the terrace and filing up the street are a series of squalid tenement houses. And here on the shore, along the Fifties is a strange sight. Set plumb down in the midst of slums, antique warehouses, discarded breweries, slaughter houses, electrical works, gas tanks, loading cranes, coal-chutes, the very wealthy have begun to establish their city residence in huge, new, palatial apartments.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The East River Terrace is one of these. Looking up this street from the vantage of the River, we see only a small portion of the back terrace and a gate; but they are enough to suggest the towering magnificence of the whole structure.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Contrasting sharply with all this richness is the diseased street below, filthy, strewn with torn newspapers and garbage from the tenements. The tenement houses are close, dark and crumbling. They crowd each other. Where there are curtains in the windows, they are streaked and faded; where there are none, we see through to hideous, water stained, peeling wallpaper, and old broken-down furniture. The fire escapes are cluttered with gutted mattresses and quilts, old clothes, bread-boxes, milk bottles, a canary cage, an occasional potted plant struggling for life.5 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly two weeks after <i>Dead End</i> premiered, Beekman Place was suddenly in the news&#x2014;not as the inspiration for Broadway&#x2019;s latest hit but as the site of a shocking murder, a crime that swiftly turned into New York&#x2019;s biggest tabloid sensation in years. Two other, even more gruesome killings would occur there within an eighteen-month span. One helped ignite a nationwide panic over a supposed epidemic of psychopathic sex crimes. The other came to be viewed as among the most spectacular American murder cases of the century.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If <i>Dead End</i> was meant to convey a message about the roots of criminality&#x2014;&#x201c;that mean streets breed gangsters&#x201d;6&#x2014;these grisly real-life crimes carried a moral of their own, one that had less to do with Kingsley&#x2019;s brand of 1930s social realism than with the Gothic nightmares of Edgar Allan Poe. Beekman Place&#x2014;a supposed bastion of safety for the privileged few&#x2014;turned out to be much like Prince Prospero&#x2019;s castellated fortress in &#x201c;The Masque of the Red Death.&#x201d; For all its wealth and glamour, it could not keep horror at bay.</p><h2>Citizens Creek: A Novel</h2><p>The <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the Oprah Book Club Pick <i>Cane River</i> brings us the evocative story of a once-enslaved man who buys his freedom after serving as a translator during the American Indian Wars, and his granddaughter, who sustains his legacy of courage.<br><br>Cow Tom, born into slavery in Alabama in 1810 and sold to a Creek Indian chief before his tenth birthday, possessed an extraordinary gift: the ability to master languages.

She lives in Northern California.Citizens Creek <br> <br>Chapter 1<br> <br>HIS MASTER&#x2019;S VOICE, testy, from the direction of the main house. He had to obey, eventually, but pretended not to hear, giving himself time, sliding his hand along the stomach line from dewlap to udder, feeling for an unfamiliar bulge or irritated patch. Good. Nothing for worry. He was sure what awaited him was another meaningless chore, or errand easily assigned to one of the others. A task not worthy of a hilis haya. A healer. He was just turned twelve, mostly a man.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tom!&#x201d;<br> <br>Hadjo chewed a lazy cud, her eyes calm, but he knew better than to believe she couldn&#x2019;t just as well deliver a fast kick, whether hurt or merely displeased, and kept his body from her firing line. She still showed no sign of shakes, thank the Great Spirit. She was full of personality among her dimmer colleagues, a bit of a show-off. He&#x2019;d named her himself, Hadjo, the Creek word for jokester. No one else would understand his choice of favorite. They&#x2019;d choose the cow that calved often and gave the most milk, or one with big haunches for a tasty stew, or the strongest, or they&#x2019;d refuse to pick at all, unable to see differences, as if one cow substituted for �another. She might not fetch highest price if put to sale, but Tom preferred clever.<br> <br>A week ago, when Hadjo refused her suckling, and turned from the grass at feed time, he worried she&#x2019;d caught milk sickness. But now he thought it nothing more than a passing malady, without �potential to hurt the tribe. He personally hand-fed Hadjo grain mixed with oil from the dried, ripe seeds of the flax plant, in the way of Old Turtle, and already saw improvement in both appetite and movement. Once sure she posed no danger, he would return her to graze with the others as she passed her time on this earth until her end, providing her milk for the tribe and her meat for the tribe, or until she was sold for currency held by Chief Yargee for the benefit of all. Once Tom ran her, he&#x2019;d know whether Hadjo was �infected with the slows. If her legs didn&#x2019;t buckle, he would declare her well. If she weakened and fell to the ground, he would separate her from the others until she succumbed, and bury the remains deep so none could feast on her poison. He owed that much to the People. If beef of milk-sick cows was eaten, or milk drunk, the system of the People would be contaminated. He&#x2019;d seen it before, in the time of his old master, before Chief Yargee. First came the person&#x2019;s loss of energy for days or weeks, followed by the terrible shaking, followed by the final gasp of breath. And the cow long dead. Old Turtle taught him the connection.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tom!&#x201d;<br> <br>He patted Hadjo on the rump, not daring to ignore the call again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Back directly,&#x201d; he promised in Mvskoke, and then again in English. He practiced every chance, the words in both languages true on his tongue.<br> <br>Hadjo continued about her business, unconcerned.<br> <br>Tom sped cross-pasture and nudged Old Turtle where he nodded under a moss-draped live oak close to the sluggish stream.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chief Yargee calls,&#x201d; Tom said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gone from the herd.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Humph.&#x201d; Old Turtle tightened his lips and squinted hard at Tom. The intense sun and passing years had turned his skin leathery, burnished to the color of dried figs, his expression unyielding. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t show too smart, boy. Mind your tongue around master.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He calls for his hilis haya,&#x201d; bragged Tom. &#x201c;Second healer,&#x201d; he immediately corrected, not wanting to offend. &#x201c;Next to you, best in the tribe.&#x201d;<br> <br>The advance of blindness and age slowed his mentor, but rheumy-eyed Old Turtle was still better in the healing of cattle than the most able-bodied man in Alabama, black or Indian. And Tom was the young hilis haya of the five hundred cattle in the herd, having watched Old Turtle minister to livestock on first Master McIntosh&#x2019;s plantation, and now, among the Upper Creeks on Chief Yargee&#x2019;s plantation.<br> <br>&#x201c;You and me, we&#x2019;re as much slave on this place as the last, though the master be more tolerable here,&#x201d; said Old Turtle.<br> <br>&#x201c;But we&#x2019;re Creek too,&#x201d; insisted Tom. He touched the red strings in his turban for luck.<br> <br>&#x201c;We are what we are. Owned by tribe&#x2019;s not the same as tribe,&#x201d; said Old Turtle. &#x201c;Straight off now and see to what the chief wants. And don&#x2019;t overstep.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom followed the banks of the Alabama River, tromping through the tall grass in the direction of the chief&#x2019;s house. He rounded the corner of the side yard&#x2019;s vegetable garden.<br> <br>Two unfamiliar horses lazed in front of his master&#x2019;s logged cabin, a three-hand roan with a fancy horned leather saddle and a smaller paint with broad pinto spotting, draped with a coarse wool riding blanket. He knew now why he&#x2019;d been called. Visitors.<br> <br>Four figures stood in an awkward knot outside the house, waiting, a different flavor of annoyance written across each distinctive face, Indian, black, and white. He caught the eye of the other Tom on the plantation, a tall pecan-colored slave two years his senior, already sprouting the beginnings of a mustache on his upper lip, caught up in the net of the same name. The other Tom answered the call more quickly, most probably from the stable, where he shod the tribe&#x2019;s ponies. They&#x2019;d found themselves in this situation before, the two Toms, and after the briefest flicker of recognition, Tom concentrated on his master, figuring how much trouble he might be in for taking too long.<br> <br>Chief Yargee threw up his hands when he saw Tom. He seemed more nettled that he had to deal with a white man than that he&#x2019;d had to wait. His master didn&#x2019;t take to strangers, especially English-speaking strangers. Yargee was full-blood, devoted more to old ways than new, and if the chief could have lived his life through without ever seeing a white face or being vulnerable to the confusing ways of the Wachenas, he would have died a man content.<br> <br>&#x201c;What took so long?&#x201d; asked Yargee in Mvskoke.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cattle trouble,&#x201d; said Tom. He thought of Old Turtle&#x2019;s warning and said nothing more, holding his breath as he waited for Chief Yargee&#x2019;s reaction.<br> <br>Distracted, Chief Yargee skimmed past Tom&#x2019;s delay and waved away the other Tom with an impatient gesture. &#x201c;They talk crazy,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>The two strangers looked uncomfortable. The short white man was smaller than the chief, dressed in a mishmash of clothing, some Indian, some store-bought cloth and American fashion, like Tom had seen before on the old plantation. The dark-skinned man wore a feathered turban, a blanket wrapped around his body Indian-style, and breeches with fur around the bottom.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am yatika.&#x201d; The black stranger spoke in thick-tongued �Mvskoke, so heavily accented he was difficult to understand.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s he say, Tom?&#x201d; Yargee asked.<br> <br>The situation came clear. Chief Yargee had little tolerance for unfamiliarity with his language. Tom had thrown himself into mastering Mvskoke as well as Creek customs and dress when Yargee bought him into the nation as his property. This white man had the foresight to bring his own interpreter, but Yargee didn&#x2019;t approve of the abuse of the language in the black man&#x2019;s mouth.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am yatika for Chief Yargee,&#x201d; Tom said in English.<br> <br>He ignored the black man&#x2019;s look of surprise and the mirrored expression of the little white man. Tom was used to doubt, to challenge, to underestimation, because he was twelve and looked younger still.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chief Yargee asks the reason for your visit.&#x201d;<br> <br>This time the white man spoke, in English. He too had an accent, but Tom made internal adjustments for his odd lilt and speech, and found him understandable.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m passing through, writing about Indians in Alabama. For my own amusement. Yes?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom wasn&#x2019;t sure how much Mvskoke the black man really understood, so he mostly performed a straight translation of the white man&#x2019;s words for Yargee without commentary or shading, but he left out the part about amusement. Chief Yargee wouldn&#x2019;t respond well, and he wanted to keep the exchange going, fascinated that a white man brought his slave dressed Cherokee-style with him as he traveled through Alabama.<br> <br>&#x201c;We feed them,&#x201d; Yargee said in Mvskoke to Tom, &#x201c;then they go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The chief invites you to sup,&#x201d; Tom translated, &#x201c;before going on your way.&#x201d; The white man seemed grateful at the offer, so Tom added, &#x201c;You and your estelvste.&#x201d;<br> <br>The black man straightened up at this last, his face suddenly flinty.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am not his,&#x201d; he said in English, pulling his blanket tighter around his shoulders. &#x201c;I am a free man, belonging only to myself. I have papers for proof. I travel without permission.&#x201d;<br> <br>This man was as dark as Tom, maybe even a shade darker, his hair kinky beneath his turban, his face broad without the slightest hint of Indian blood. Every black man, woman, boy, or girl Tom had ever known was owned by white or Indian. Masters differed in temperament and treatment, in wealth and in influence, but so far as he knew, any with one drop of Negro blood were slaves. He&#x2019;d seen official papers before, sheaves of parchment his former master kept in a locked rolltop desk no one was allowed to touch, except to keep dusted. Master McIntosh used to pull these papers out each month and worry over them, scratching black ink across the pages with a goose-quill feather pen. He&#x2019;d add new sheets to the stack whenever he made a sale or a purchase on the plantation. Tom wondered if the black man&#x2019;s proof papers looked like those.<br> <br>Tom wasn&#x2019;t supposed to know how to read or write, but Master McIntosh sent his son to the white man&#x2019;s school, and in the beginning, the boy showed Tom the individual squiggles of letters he said were the mortar and pestle of the white men&#x2019;s books in his father&#x2019;s library. Tom practiced them when alone. That was before the son outgrew their small-boy friendship and went on to embrace the life his father laid out for him, where Tom&#x2019;s function was to serve, not accompany. But Tom could write his own name and pick out some words. Once he came to Yargee, the chief didn&#x2019;t care one way or the other if Tom could read, so long as he performed his chores. Yargee had no knowledge of the written word, and cared about only the valuable cattle-tending skills gained for the tribe when he bought in Old Turtle and young Tom together.<br> <br>Tom looked to Yargee, but his master had scant interest in an exchange in a language he didn&#x2019;t understand and which promised to impact him little. Still, Tom translated the black man&#x2019;s words, the freedom declaration.<br> <br>Yargee didn&#x2019;t comment, but didn&#x2019;t laugh either, or protest the absurdity of the claim. A free black man. Sometimes you had to see a thing to know the possibility of it. He&#x2019;d ask Old Turtle later.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mightn&#x2019;t I ask Chief Yargee about his life as Upper Creek in Alabama?&#x201d; asked the white man.<br> <br>Tom translated.<br> <br>The chief grabbed up his bois d&#x2019;arc bow and a full quiver of arrows. &#x201c;Have cook lay supper and food for them to carry away,&#x201d; he said in Mvskoke.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chief Yargee meets with Council now, but asks me to see you eat and drink to your fill.&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;d get these men to himself before sending them off. If only he could learn how one came by freedom, with papers as proof. Or glimpse a world beyond an Alabama plantation.<br> <br>The white man seemed particularly disappointed, but that didn&#x2019;t burden Chief Yargee. He pulled Tom to the side.<br> <br>&#x201c;From now, won&#x2019;t be two Toms,&#x201d; Yargee whispered in Mvskoke. &#x201c;Your name is Cow Tom, and his is Horse Tom, and you come soon as I call.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Chief Yargee.&#x201d;<br> <br>Yargee headed toward the woods without a backward glance, leaving Cow Tom to handle the visitors.<br> <br>Later, alone, with the two men fed and on their way, Tom found the twinkle of the star that never moved in the northern sky to accept his nightly prayer. He conjured up his most precious memory. His mother, her callused hands so warm at the nape of his neck, humming some nameless, soothing tune as she tilted his head and spooned her concocted herbal brew between his lips as he lay sick of a childhood disease on a straw pallet. A pause to her crooning, and something cool on his forehead, and the timbre of her voice, rich enough to tame pain or hurt that he still played back the melody of it whenever he fell into sadness. &#x201c;Come, boy,&#x201d; she said then. &#x201c;My Tom. Be well. You&#x2019;re meant for special things. Be well now.&#x201d;<br> <br>He missed her.<br> <br>His star called to him. First, he wished his mother safe. He wished she would come back. He wished for guidance on how to be special. And now he had something new to add to his list.

He was convinced that photography was a means of expression as efficient as literature, and his images were accompanied by writings, essays, excerpts from books, and aphorisms. Gedney avoided self-promotion, and his underrepresented work was largely unknown during his short lifetime. He died at the age of fifty-six from AIDS.</p><p><i>William Gedney: Only the Lonely, 1955&#x2013;1984</i> is the first comprehensive retrospective of his photography. It presents images from all of his major series, including eastern Kentucky, where Gedney lived with and photographed the family of laid-off coal miner Willie Cornett; San Francisco and Haight-Ashbury, where he attached himself to a group of disaffected youth, photographing them as they drifted from one vacant apartment to the next during the &#x201c;Summer of Love&#x201d;; early photo-reportage of gay pride parades in the eighties; Benares, India, Gedney&#x2019;s first trip abroad, during which he obsessively chronicled the concurrent difficulty and beauty of daily life; and night scenes that, in the absence of people and movement, evoke a profound universal loneliness. The most complete overview of Gedney&#x2019;s work to date, this volume reveals the undeniable beauty of a major American photographer. </p></p><p>Gilles Mora has been the editor in chief of the magazine Les Cahiers de la Photographie, an editor with �ditions du Seuil in Paris, and the artistic director of the Rencontres Internationales de la Photographie in Arles.

The theme continues of paradisaical containment in good Mother Nature. This represents a numinous nature-experience, a healing encounter with the original source of one's being. It is reminiscent of Jung's earliest memory: I am lying in a pram, in the shadow of a tree. It is a fine warm summer day, the sky blue, and golden sunlight darting through the green leaves. The hood of the pram has been left up. I have just awakened to the glorious beauty of the day, and have a sense of indescribable we-being. I see the sun Glittering through the leaves and blossoms of the bushes. Everything is wholly wonderful, colorful and splendid." (Memories, Dreams, Reflections, p. 6) <br><br>The paintings in this book provide a rare opportunity to experience the work of an artist and the reality of the living psyche. The patient/artist began analysis at the age of 36 with the chief complaint that, despite a successful career in the arts, he had lost his sense of purpose in life and was on the verge of despair. The pictures were done over a period of five years during the course of Jungian analysis. They touch on all the major themes of the analysis and constitute a remarkable record of analytic experience that ranged from the heights to the depths, from the infernal to the sublime.</p><p><b>Edward F. Edinger</b>, MD (1922-1998), was a supervising psychiatrist at Rockland State Hospital in Orangeburg, NY, and later was a founding member of the C. G. Jung Foundation, Manhattan, and the C. G.

Perfect company in bed * Salley Vickers * Inspector Morse would appear to have a rival * Scotland on Sunday * A charmingly effective tale of detection ... evoking oodles of churchy village atmosphere, circa 1953, provides a satisfyingly old-fashioned read * The Times * The clerical milieu is well rendered as an affectionate eye is cast over post-war England - a perfect accompaniment to a sunny afternoon, a hammock and a glass of Pimm&#39;s -- Laura Wilson * Guardian * James Runcie has written the coziest of cozy murder mysteries. Taken individually, each of these clerical whodunits poses a clever puzzle for armchair detectives. Viewed as a collective study of British life as it was lived when Elizabeth II first ascended the throne, these stories present a consistently charming and occasionally cutting commentary on &#39;a postwar landscape full of industry, promise and concrete * New York Times Book Review * An undiluted pleasure * Scotsman * What a bloody fantastic thing ... this could only be improved by finding a winning Euromillions ticket tucked in the pages * Rev Richard Coles on Twitter * Full of witty phrases to delight the reader ... This entertaining first volume about Canon Chambers will have Runcie&#39;s readers longing for the next * Peggy Woodford, Church Times * An evocation of a more genteel era ... Chambers turns out to be a winning clergyman-sleuth, and Runcie&#39;s literary authority is repeatedly demonstrated in the construction of his elegant tales. In fact, it is the plotting that really distinguishes this collection, and will make many more readers more than ready to follow the God-fearing hero from the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953 to the wedding of Charles and Diana in 1981 ... there is no denying the winning charm of these artfully fashioned mysteries * Independent * Gentle criminal entertainment with a pleasantly old-fashioned feel to it -- Andrew Taylor * Spectator * The plots are intriguing ... While the diminutive priest detective created by G. K. Chesterton led the way, Sidney Chambers is set fair to be a worthy successor. In a sceptical age this is quite an achievement. Then again, the author is a son of an archbishop. And who better to portray the sleuth in ecclesiastical clothing? -- Barry Turner * Daily Mail * At last, an Anglican Father Brown ... Each tale is beautifully crafted and surprising. I hope for many more volumes -- A.N. Wilson * Spectator *</p><h2>Thirty Years of The Rockford Files: An Inside Look at America&#39;s Greatest Detective Series</h2><p>&#x201c;An important history in the entertainment world.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>The Salisbury Post</i><p></p> <p>&#x201c;The most comprehensive episode guide ever seen in any book.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>Television Chronicles</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Another great work by Robertson...He&#x2019;s still the standard by which TV reference should be judged.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;<i>Popocalypse World of Fun</i></p> <p>He looked like Steve McGarrett.

A horizon line, maybe. But also a slot for blackness to pour through...</b> <br> <br> A terrible construction site accident takes Edgar Freemantle's right arm and scrambles his memory and his mind, leaving him with little but rage as he begins the ordeal of rehabilitation. A marriage that produced two lovely daughters suddenly ends, and Edgar begins to wish he hadn't survived the injuries that could have killed him. He wants out. His psychologist, Dr. Kamen, suggests a "geographic cure," a new life distant from the Twin Cities and the building business Edgar grew from scratch. And Kamen suggests something else. <br> <br> <i>"Edgar, does anything make you happy?" <br> <br> "I used to sketch." <br> <br> "Take it up again. You need hedges... hedges against the night."</i> <br> <br> Edgar leaves Minnesota for a rented house on Duma Key, a stunningly beautiful, eerily undeveloped splinter of the Florida coast. The sun setting into the Gulf of Mexico and the tidal rattling of shells on the beach call out to him, and Edgar draws. A visit from Ilse, the daughter he dotes on, starts his movement out of solitude. He meets a kindred spirit in Wireman, a man reluctant to reveal his own wounds, and then Elizabeth Eastlake, a sick old woman whose roots are tangled deep in Duma Key. Now Edgar paints, sometimes feverishly, his exploding talent both a wonder and a weapon. Many of his paintings have a power that cannot be controlled. When Elizabeth's past unfolds and the ghosts of her childhood begin to appear, the damage of which they are capable is truly devastating. <br> The tenacity of love, the perils of creativity, the mysteries of memory and the nature of the supernatural -- Stephen King gives us a novel as fascinating as it is gripping and terrifying.</p><p><b>Amazon Significant Seven, January 2008</b>: It would be impossible to convey the wonder and the horror of Stephen King's latest novel in just a few words. Suffice it to say that <i>Duma Key</i>, the story of Edgar Freemantle and his recovery from the terrible nightmare-inducing accident that stole his arm and ended his marriage, is Stephen King's most brilliant novel to date (outside of the <i>Dark Tower</i> novels, in which case <i>each</i> is arguably his best work). <i>Duma Key</i> is as rich and rewarding as <i>Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption</i> (yes, <i>that</i> <i>Shawshank Redemption</i>), and as truly scary as anything King has written (and that's saying a lot). Readers who have "always wanted to try Stephen King" but never known where to start should try a few pages of <i>Duma Key</i>--the frankness with which Edgar reveals his desperate, sputtering rages and thoughts of suicide is King at the top of his game. And that's just the first thirty pages... <i>--Daphne Durham</i> <p></p><p></p><p> <strong><i>Duma Key</i>: Where It All Began</strong><br> <b>A Note from Chuck Verrill, the Longtime Editor of Stephen King</b><br> In the spring of 2006 Stephen King told me he was working on a Florida story that was beginning to grow on him. "I'm thinking of calling it <i>Duma Key</i>," he offered. I liked the sound of that--the title was like a drumbeat of dread. "You know how <i>Lisey's Story</i> is a story about marriage?" he said. "Sure," I answered. The novel hadn't yet been published, but I knew its story well: Lisey and Scott Landon--what a marriage that was. Then he dropped the other shoe: "I think <i>Duma Key</i> might be my story of divorce." </p><p> Pretty soon I received a slim package from a familiar address in Maine. Inside was a short story titled "Memory"--a story of divorce, all right, but set in Minnesota. By the end of the summer, when <i>Tin House</i> published "Memory," Stephen had completed a draft of <i>Duma Key</i>, and it became clear to me how "Memory" and its narrator, Edgar Freemantle, had moved from Minnesota to Florida, and how a story of divorce had turned into something more complex, more strange, and much more terrifying. </p><p> If you read the following two texts side by side--"Memory" as it was published by <i>Tin House</i> and the opening chapter of <i>Duma Key</i> in final form--you'll see a writer at work, and how stories can both contract and expand. Whether <i>Duma Key</i> is an expansion of "Memory" or "Memory" a contraction of <i>Duma Key</i>, I can't really say. Can you? </p><p> <i>--Chuck Verrill</i> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td><table> <tbody><tr> <td><b>"Memory"</b><br>Memories are contrary things; if you quit chasing them and turn your back, they often return on their own. That's what Kamen says. I tell him I never chased the memory of my accident. Some things, I say, are better forgotten.<p>Maybe, but that doesn&#x2019;t matter, either. That's what Kamen says.</p><p>My name is Edgar Freemantle. I used to be a big deal in building and construction. This was in Minnesota, in my other life. I was a genuine American-boy success in that life, worked my way up like a motherf---er, and for me, everything worked out. When Minneapolis&#x2013;St. Paul boomed, The Freemantle Company boomed. When things tightened up, I never tried to force things. But I played my hunches, and most of them played out well. By the time I was fifty, Pam and I were worth about forty million dollars. And what we had together still worked. I looked at other women from time to time but never strayed.

By the time it did, my wife had passed, too. She's remarried to a fellow who owns bowling alleys. My older daughter likes him. My younger daughter thinks he&#x2019;s a yank-off.

I can't remember the quality and pitch of that pain now. I know it was excruciating, but it's all pretty academic. Like a picture of a mountain in <i>National Geographic</i> magazine.

National ad/promo.</p><p>A rich, humane, well-researched discourse on Italians in America, by Mangione (An Ethnic at Large, 1978, etc.) and Morreale (Monday, Tuesday...Never Come Sunday, 1977). By marshalling abundant, striking, and unexpected facts, the authors create a fresh view of the Italian contribution to American culture. Amerigo Vespucci emerges as an ambiguous hustler, while the forgotten Fillipo Mazzei comes alive as a man at the heart of the birth of our nation--friend of and influence upon Italophile Thomas Jefferson and ``prime mover in founding and organizing a constitutional society whose members included James Madison, James Monroe, and Edmond Randolph.'' Equally memorable is Count Luigi Cesnola, Union officer and Confederate prisoner, art dealer and first director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The brutal realities of turn-of-the-century immigration and of the melting-pot squalor of the resulting Italian ghettos are portrayed matter-of- factly, but the authors also explore little-known Italian-American outposts in Louisiana (where their communes prospered), Texas (where immigrants were ripped even off more outrageously than usual), and even in Arizona, where N.Y.C.'s future mayor Fiorella La Guardia spent some formative years. It all adds up to a powerful look at a heritage often overwhelmed by the dominant Anglo culture, and to a strong antidote to the mafia-mythology so dear to the media. The facts are all here, but what makes the book hum are a vigor and tone unique to writers tempered in the liberal-left tradition of the Thirties, for whom humanity and social issues are truly of the essence. (Thirty-two pages of b&amp;w photos--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The core of this gripping, panoramic chronicle is the mass emigration of Italians to the U.S. between 1880 and 1924. Their road to assimilation was marked by hard work, family solidarity, tradition-laden weddings and joyous festivals, but also by poverty, miserable housing, dangerous working conditions and marriages that "often seethed with tensions" despite a public image of unity and warmth. Mangione ( Mussolini's March on Rome ) and Morreale ( A Few Virtuous Men ) trace discrimination against Italian Americans, arguing that politicians and the media fanned prejudice after WW II by resurrecting the Mafia image of the 1890s. They discuss Italian Americans' awareness or denial of their heritage, providing cameos of Sacco and Vanzetti, Fiorello LaGuardia, Frank Sinatra, Don DeLillo, John Ciardi, Francis Coppola and dozens more. Early chapters discuss Italian adventurers (such as Columbus) and Italians who fought in the American Revolution and the Civil War; a later one touches on intermarriage and divorce, which have contributed to the decline of immigrant culture. A magnificent saga that illuminates a century of accomplishment and struggle.

The need for one million Chinese Bibles is urgently requested and a team of ordinary men respond with a strong faith in an extraordinary, miracle-working God. Using a tugboat and a specially-designed barge, twenty men clandestinely deliver one million Chinese Bibles - 232 tons - in one night to thousands of Chinese Christians waiting on a beach in southern China. But the untold story is the million miracles that occurred in getting to that night of delivery. This story of Project Pearl will help you understand how and why the revival sweeping through China was fueled by the infusion of one million Bibles.</p><p>Rev. Paul Estabrooks is a veteran foreign missionary with a deep concern for Christians in restricted countries. He has completed thirty years of ministry to Persecuted Christians with Open Doors.

Prior to joining Open Doors, Estabrooks - whose roots are in Maritime Eastern Canada - served eight years with the Far East Broadcasting Company in Manila, Philippines as head of Overseas Programming. It was during these years of considerable travel throughout Asia that he developed an awareness and concern for Christians in spiritual need in countries like China, Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia, India and Burma. He was the project coordinator for Open Doors&#39; Project Pearl - the delivery of one million Chinese Bibles (232 tons) on one night - June 18, 1981.

They flocked to the studios of French artists like Jean-L�on G�r�me, William Bouguereau, and others, dreamed of showing their work at the annual Paris Salon, and watched intently as new styles such as Impressionism began to take hold. Hardly an American painter was unaffected by developments in Paris, and even those who chose not to study there wanted their work to be affirmed by French audiences and taste makers. This beautifully illustrated book traces the role of American artists in Paris from the Salon des Refus�s, in 1863, to the emergence of a uniquely American style of painting at the turn of the century. It includes iconic images by John Singer Sargent, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Mary Cassatt, and Winslow Homer, and by many other artists whose names and work were more widely known then than now. Engaging essays written by notable scholars explore why artists were drawn to Paris, how they responded to what they found there, and what they retained of their experience. In addition, the significance of the Expositions Universelles, the French view of American artists in Paris, and the role these artists played in shaping the great American collections of modern French painting are discussed. Featuring more than 100 paintings, the essays are followed by artists&#39; biographies, an illustrated, annotated list of works, and a complete bibliography.</p><p></p><h2>Nightmare in Dallas</h2><p>An eyewitness to the assassination of President Kennedy recounts the event and its influence on her life afterwards, her drug abuse, the deaths of her two babies, and her friendship with Jack Ruby</p><p></p><h2>Field Guide to the Water Life of Britain (Nature Lover&#39;s Library)</h2><p>A guide which features the range of salt- and freshwater creatures and plants to be found in Britain.

He attended Manhattan&#39;s High School of Industrial Art and, while still a student, found work ghosting the Bat Masterson syndicated newspaper strip and drawing gag cartoons for Archie Comics. Neal received his own comic strip, based on the popular TV series Ben Casey, in 1962. The strip ran until 1965 at which time Neal made the move to comics for Warren Publishing and DC Comics. Neal&#39;s realistic style on such strips as DEADMAN and GREEN LANTERN/GREEN ARROW, at odds with the more cartoony comics of the day, made him an immediate star. He became DC&#39;s premier cover artist, contributing radical and dynamic illustrations to virtually the company&#39;s entire line. Neal&#39;s work has also appeared in Marvel&#39;s X-Men, the Avengers and Thor, on paperback book covers, and on stage, as the art director for the Broadway science fiction play, Warp. In the 1970s, Neal and partner (and frequent inker) Dick Giordano started the art agency Continuity Associates out of which came, in the 1980s, Continuity Comics. Neal is the winner of several Alley, Shazam and Inkpot Awards, and was inducted into the Harvey Awards&#39; Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1999."It's completely sincere and utterly wonderful.

This definitive book relates the history of the silver flatware made by others and retailed by Tiffany 1845-c.1876 as well as that designed and made in-house 1869-1905. The story is woven into the broader fabric of the history of flatware in general and that of dining and food. The development and proliferation of many different flatware pieces in America are analysed and compared with the same in England, France and Germany.

At the dawning of what would become the modern civil rights movement, he forged a record of accomplishment that defied the odds. The Library of America now presents a collection of his writings that displays the many facets of a complex and impassioned writer.<br><br><i>The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</i>&nbsp;(1912), Johnson&#x2019;s first book, is a novel that on its original anonymous publication was taken by many for an actual memoir. A groundbreaking work of modern fiction, it powerfully describes the inner development of a gifted, socially alienated man as he tries to come to terms with the constraints of racism.<br><br><i>Along This Way</i>&nbsp;(1933) is Johnson&#x2019;s genial and enthralling account of his fantastically busy life, with a cast of characters including W.E.B. Du Bois, Paul Robeson, Clarence Darrow, Booker T. Washington, Theodore Roosevelt, Carl Van Vechten, and many others.<br><br>A selection of shorter prose&#x2014;editorials from The&nbsp;<i>New York Age</i>, political essays, literary prefaces, an excerpt from the historical study&nbsp;<i>Black Manhattan</i>&#x2014;confirms the variety of Johnson&#x2019;s interests, as he comments on figures and topics including Jack Johnson, Marcus Garvey, Woodrow Wilson, lynching, anti-Japanese discrimination in California, American involvement in Haiti, changing trends in theater and poetry, and the significance of spirituals.<br><br>Johnson&#x2019;s poetry is represented by the full text of&nbsp;<i>God&#x2019;s Trombones</i>&nbsp;(1927), his stirring homage to African-American preaching, and shorter works including &#x201c;O Black and Unknown Bards,&#x201d; lyrics from Johnson&#x2019;s Broadway songwriting days, and &#x201c;Lift Every Voice and Sing,&#x201d; the hymn often referred to as the &#x201c;Negro National Anthem.&#x201d;<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.</p><p><b>James Weldon Johnson</b> was born in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1871. Among the first to break through the barriers segregating his race, he was educated at Atlanta University and at Columbia and was the first black admitted to the Florida bar. He was also, for a time, a songwriter in New York, American consul in Venezuela and Nicaragua, executive secretary of the NAACP, and professor of creative literature at Fisk University&#x2014;experiences recorded in his autobiography, <b>Along This Way</b>. Other books by him include <b>Saint Peter Relates an Incident</b>, <b>Black Manhattan</b>, and <b>God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse.</b> In addition to his own writing, Johnson was the editor of pioneering anthologies of black American poetry and spirituals. He died in 1938.&#x201c;<i>The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</i>&nbsp;established James Weldon Johnson as the first truly modern black American novelist, while his&nbsp;<i>Along This Way</i>, published two decades later (in 1933), recounted his rich life as a diplomat, journalist, songwriter, and secretary to the NAACP. This collection of his writings, which includes both of those longer works plus several rare essays, poems, and songs, is yet another important volume in The Library of America series.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Dallas Morning News</i></b></p><h2>Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa</h2><p>Mungo Park&#x2019;s <i>Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa</i> has long been regarded as a classic of African travel literature. In fulfilling his mission to find the Niger River and in documenting its potential as an inland waterway for trade, Park was significant in opening Africa to European economic interests. His modest, low-key heroism made it possible for the British public to imagine themselves as a welcomed force in Africa. As a tale of adventure and survival, it has inspired the imaginations of readers since its first publication in 1799 and writers from Wordsworth and Melville to Conrad, Hemingway, and T. Coreghessan Boyle have acknowledged the influence of Park&#x2019;s narrative on their work. <br> Unlike the large expeditions that followed him, Park traveled only with native guides or alone. Without much of an idea of where he was going, he relied entirely on local people for food, shelter, and directions throughout his eventful eighteen month journey. While his warm reaction to the people he met made him famous as a sentimental traveler, his chronicle also provides a rare written record of the lives of ordinary people in West Africa before European intervention. His accounts of war, politics, and the spread of Islam, as well as his constant confrontations with slavery as practiced in eighteenth-century West Africa, are as valuable today as they were in 1799. In preparing this new edition, editor Kate Ferguson Marsters presents the complete text and includes reproductions of all the original maps and illustrations. <br> Park&#x2019;s narrative serves as a crucial text in relation to scholarship on the history of slavery, colonial enterprise, and nineteenth-century imperialism. The availability of this full edition will give a new generation of readers access to a travel narrative that has inspired other readers and writers over two centuries and will enliven scholarly discussion in many fields.<br></p><p>&#34;In a time when the world has grown tame and we have to manufacture our adventures, Mungo Park&#39;s &#34;Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa&#34; is both an education and a delight. The Africa he entered was uncharted and unknown, the farthest outpost of a truly wild and richly mysterious planet. He was the first European to go there and come back again, and he rewarded his society--and ours--with a geographical and anthropological marvel of a book, an adventure story to cap them all.&#34;--T. Coraghessan Boyle<p>Mungo Park (1771&#x2013;1805) was a Scottish explorer who, at the age of twenty-four, travelled alone to Africa in search of the Niger River. A decade later, he returned to Africa on an ill-fated second mission, this time sponsored by the British government. Though there were no survivors of this journey, Park and the last few members of his expedition were reported to have met their deaths while attempting to follow the Niger to its end.

His Latin translation of Winnie-the-Pooh, which took seven years to complete, was published in the UK in 1960 and immediately became a bestseller. A.A. Milne wrote some 18 plays and three novels, and fathered a son, Christopher Robin Milne, in 1920. Christopher led Milne to produce a book of children&#39;s poetry, When We Were Very Young, in 1924, and in 1926 the seminal Winnie-the-Pooh. More poems followed in Now We Are Six (1927) and Pooh returned in The House at Pooh Corner (1928). E. H. Shepard famously illustrated both Winnie-the-Pooh and The Wind in the Willows though, like A.

His work has been translated into two dozen languages and produced as four feature-length films. In 2007, Mr. Harrison was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He divides his time between Montana and southern Arizona.Harrison's poetry is earthy in the fullest sense of the word: it is of the earth, stoked by the senses, in sync with the beat of life, and salty in its forthrightness. Harrison gleans lessons from rivers, the moon, birds, and dogs, and puzzles over the elusive nature of time, tagging clocks as "the machinery of dread." He writes sharply of war, the "loathsome" government, the distortions of religion, and humankind's "will toward greed and self-destruction." A veteran fiction writer, Hollywood darling, hard-living and deep-thinking poet, Harrison brings tough love to the puzzles of existence and a meditative perspective to life's mysteries as he evokes the wilds of Montana and cherished small towns. He remembers the dead, savors life's bittersweetness, its push and pull, its "swish and swash," and knows in his very cells that "salvation isn't coming. It's always been here." Harrison may be under doctor's orders to count his drinks and measure the sugar in his blood, but this is his most robust, sure-footed, and spirit-raising poetry collection to date. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Wink uses this phrase to explore not only early Christology but the anthropology articulated in the Gospels. Jesus apparently avoided designations such as Messiah, Son of God, or God, though these titles were given by his disciples after his death and resurrection. But Jesus is repeatedly depicted as using the obscure expression &#34;the Human Being&#34; as virtually his only form of self- reference. Wink explores how Jesus&#39; self-referential phrase came to be universalized as the &#34;Human Being&#34; or &#34;Truly Human One.&#34; The Human Being is a catalytic agent for transformation, providing the form and lure and hunger to become who we were meant to be, or more properly perhaps, to become who we truly are.</p><p><p><b>Walter Wink</b> was professor emeritus of biblical interpretation at Auburn Theological Seminary in New York City.

Published in Germany in 1969, it is only now appearing in an authorized English translation. Concerning a former cafe owner who fabricates the story of the Russian army&#39;s inexorable advance on the ghetto, and the liberation that will follow their arrival, the tale has the simple power of myths or dreams. A comic tale of unimaginable tragedy, the novel brings vividly to life the doomed inhabitants of the ghetto: Schmidt, the obtuse assimilationist; the child, Lina, who hunts for Jacob&#39;s imaginary radio; Frankfurte,r the formerly obese burgher. And Jacob himself, a storyteller whose inventions become like bread to the others, who finds himself trapped in his growing mesh of lies until he is driven to tell the truth. At the end there are two final passages: one in which the Russians arrive to save the ghetto; and one in which they don&#39;t. Who is to distinguish between fact and myth?Jurek Becker was born in L�dz, Poland. The exact date of his birth is unknown, because, while the family was living in the L�dz ghetto, his father made him out to be older in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent him from being deported. From 1939 until 1945, Jurek Becker was a prisoner in the concentration camps of Ravensbr�ck and Sachsenhausen. After the war, Becker&#39;s father took him to East Berlin, where they were among few surviving Jews who chose to stay in Germany. An acclaimed screen-writer and novelist, Becker won several literary prizes including the Heinrich-Mann and the Charles Veillon Prizes for Jacob the Liar .He died in 1997.</p><h2>Coco: A Story about Music, Shoes, and Family</h2><p>Inspired by Pixar Animation Studios' latest film, <i>Coco</i>, this middle grade novel retells the story of Miguel's daring adventure, and features exciting new scenes about his family.<br>Disney*Pixar's <i>Coco</i> is the celebration of a lifetime, where the discovery of a generations-old mystery leads to a most extraordinary and surprising family reunion.

"My favorite person in the world is coming for a visit," the narrator announces as a cheery watercolor illustration depicts grandfather and grandson greeting each other. The narrator then imagines all the fun things in store: sharing knock-knock jokes, snacks ("We love hot chocolate, with as many marshmallows as we want!"), a game of dominoes ("I hate to lose. Come on, just one more game") and a ride in the car with the top down ("Even when it's freezing"). But as the list of favorite pursuits draws to a close, readers will be surprised to learn who has been doing the talking. Skillfully blending warmth and youthful exuberance, Shields's lighthearted and immediate text holds appeal for a wide range of readers. Debut illustrator Nakata serves up a series of perky vignettes that seemingly dance on the white page. She creates a coziness with loose lines, homey details and plenty of smiling facesAsomething like a blend of the styles of Elisha Cooper, Holly Berry and Jennifer Plecas.

Many pamphlets, booklets and even books have been produced over the past century to help with old handwriting and abbreviations, but this new work, written by an author who has for years run courses on the subject, is the most practical and comprehensive yet for family and local historians. Based on some fifty facsimile reproductions of documents of graduated difficulty, culled from many useful sources, it provides transcripts, and translations where appropriate, together with advice on methods of transcribing. The alphabet, with commentary, of the numerous types of letter to be found in the examples (many being in the secretary and court hands which so often cause problems), and illustrations of forms of abbreviation will greatly help to unravel the difficulties of reading. Many documents before 1733 were written in Latin and the author includes an outline of the differences between classical and medieval usage and a vocabulary to cover the section in Latin. There are examples, from the 1400s to the 1700s, of a wide range of hands found in the most usual categories of record used by family historians, such as parish registers, wills and court rolls, and in many others which disclose helpful information on families and localities. Those who use this book will not need to be persuaded of the great enjoyment to be derived from pursuing research into family or local history and the pleasures of piecing together evidence to throw new light on old times. They may also find great enjoyment in the deciphering of documents, the means to that end. For the solitary searcher or a member of a class or local society, this will be the standard work upon which to rely for many decades to come.</p><p></p><h2>The Civilization of the Middle Ages: A Completely Revised and Expanded Edition of Medieval History, the Life and Death of a Civilization</h2><p>Cantor, Norman F., Civilization Of The Middle Ages, The</p><p>NORMAN F.

Wolfe answers that question in this history of the rise and fall of Texas's Murchison family. Clint Murchison Sr. began building the family fortune selling animal skins for pennies; later with interests in oil, real estate, and publishing, he was one of the first conglomerate makers. His elder son, John, won Wall Street's biggest proxy fight, developed the Vail, Colorada ski resort, and was a noted jet-setter. Clint Jr., probably best known as the builder and first owner of the Dallas Cowboys, was also a philanderer and deal-maker. Eventually, skyrocketing interest rates and plummeting oil and real estate prices led him to one of the largest personal bankruptcies in history. While his "financing by finagling" precipitated the crash, the family's downfall also resulted from bitter lawsuits in the third generation. In the long run, the Cowboys may be the family's biggest memorial. For public libraries interested in the history of the oil business or Texas, or in the exploits of the wealthy.<br><i>- Sue Kamm, Los Angeles P.L.</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Wolfe tells a riveting tale of the rising fortunes and ultimate downfall of the Murchison family, quintessential high rollers. Clint Murchison Sr. erupted from East Texas during the rough-and-tumble years of oil drilling in the 1930s, and spent his life "doing deals." Wolfe gives a colorful description of a quiet, unpretentious man whose financial acumen and brilliant use of leverage helped him build a multimillion-dollar conglomerate. His sons Clint Jr. and John shared their father's wizardry, adding to their investment firmament the Vail, Colo., ski resort and the Dallas Cowboys. However, the family's style of loose management and easy credit based on a handshake was ill-suited to the late 1970s, when oil prices toppled and interest rates soared. In her first book, Wolfe, former society editor of the Dallas Morning News , gives a superb glimpse of the personal lives and family dynamics of these millionaires whose bankruptcy in 1985 stunned both the state of Texas and the nation's financial community.

Based upon a traditional Russian folktale collected by Alexander Afanasyev in the 19th century, this competent translation captures the flavor of Tsarist Russia and the contrast between the social classes. The brevity and simplicity of the folktale allows Spirin to create an elaborate world in which such fantasy seems probable. Executed in what appears to be a combination of watercolor and ink, thefull-page paintings seem influenced by the style of Brueghel and the minutia of European illuminated manuscripts. The dark palette and highly realistic detailing of the illustrations make for arresting art, but it will probably appeal more to adults than to children. Libraries able to maintain large folklore collections or those with a special interest in Soviet art will best appreciate this visually intriguing work. --Denise Anton Wright, Library Book Selection Service, Inc., Bloomington, IL<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Measureless Peril: America in the Fight for the Atlantic, the Longest Battle of World War II</h2><p>Of all the threats that faced his country in World War II, Winston Churchill said, just one really scared him&#x2014;what he called the "measureless peril" of the German U-boat campaign. <p>In that global conflagration, only one battle&#x2014;the struggle for the Atlantic&#x2014;lasted from the very first hours of the conflict to its final day. Hitler knew that victory depended on controlling the sea-lanes where American food and fuel and weapons flowed to the Allies. At the start, U-boats patrolled a few miles off the eastern seaboard, savagely attacking scores of defenseless passenger ships and merchant vessels while hastily converted American cabin cruisers and fishing boats vainly tried to stop them. Before long, though, the United States was ramping up what would be the greatest production of naval vessels the world had ever known. </p><p>Then the battle became a thrilling cat-and-mouse game between the quickly built U.S. warships and the ever-more cunning and lethal U-boats. The historian Richard Snow captures all the drama of the merciless contest at every level, from the doomed sailors on an American freighter defying a German cruiser, to the amazing Allied attempts to break the German naval codes, to Winston Churchill pressing Franklin Roosevelt to join the war months before Pearl Harbor (and FDR&#x2019;s shrewd attempts to fight the battle alongside Britain while still appearing to keep out of it). </p><p></p><p>Inspired by the collection of letters that his father sent his mother from the destroyer escort he served aboard, Snow brings to life the longest continuous battle in modern times. </p><p>&nbsp;With its vibrant prose and fast-paced action, <i>A Measureless Peril </i>is an immensely satisfying account that belongs on the small shelf of the finest histories ever written about World War II.</p></p><p><b>Richard Snow </b>was born in New York City and he graduated with a B.A. from Columbia College in 1970. He worked at <i>American Heritage </i>magazine for nearly four decades and was its editor-in-chief for seventeen years. He is the author of several books, among them two novels and a volume of poetry. Snow has served as a consultant for historical motion picture&#x2014;among them <i>Glory&#x2014;</i>and has written for documentaries, including the Burns brothers&#x2019; <i>Civil War</i>, and Ric Burns&#x2019;s award-winning PBS film <i>Coney Island</i>, whose screenplay he wrote. Most recently, he served as a consultant on Ken Burns&#x2019;s World War II series, <i>The War</i>.<b></b><b>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the Matter with the <i>Davis</i>?&#x201d;</b> <p><b></b></p><i>Looking back on the Atlantic struggle</i> <p>One hot, windy September afternoon in the early 1970s my mother and father came home to Bronxville from a two-week vacation in Maine. Bronxville is a town in Westchester County, half an hour north of Manhattan on what was then the Penn Central railroad. Like countless thousands of other couples, my mother, Emma, and my father, Richard, had quit the city in the hopeful months after World War II ended to raise their infant child in a house surrounded by suburban greenery and well-nourished public schools. </p><p>The beneficiary of this relocation came down to help them unload their luggage, and I was soon joined by Mr. Curcio, the superintendent of the apartment building in the village my parents had moved into after I&#x2019;d gotten out of college. </p><p>Superintendent Curcio was a chatty, affable, powerfully built man (he once paused halfway up a flight of stairs to speculate with me at some length about the Mets&#x2019; chances, all the time holding two air conditioners, one under each arm). He scooped a half dozen suitcases out of the Chrysler, and as we headed toward the apartment, something&#x2014;the weather, perhaps&#x2014;reminded him of having taken part in the landings on Sicily in July 1943, and he began to talk about it. </p><p>&#x201c;Look, I&#x2019;m a wop,&#x201d; he said cheerfully about his Italian heritage, &#x201c;but let me tell you, once those wops on the beach were shooting at me, I was one hundred percent American. Guys begin dropping around me, and I start firing while I&#x2019;m still in the water.&#x201d; </p><p>The story continued until the suitcases were in front of the door. We all said thanks, and then my mother put a protective hand on my father&#x2019;s forearm. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad,&#x201d; she told Mr. Curcio, &#x201c;that Dick was never in action.&#x201d; </p><p>AT A LITTLE AFTER eight thirty on the morning of April 24, 1945, a sailor said to my father, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter with the <i>Davis</i>?&#x201d; He meant the <i>Frederick C. Davis</i>, destroyer escort 136, and she looked funny, canted forward and apparently stopped in the water. My father was watching her from the deck of another destroyer escort, the USS <i>Neunzer</i>, DE-150. The <i>Davis</i> lay a few hundred yards away, but not for long. &#x201c;Jesus Christ!&#x201d; said someone. &#x201c;She took a fish.&#x201d; And sure enough, although nobody aboard the <i>Neunzer</i> had heard the explosion, a torpedo had struck the <i>Davis</i>&#x2019;s forward engine room. Minutes later the <i>Davis</i> split apart and sank, taking 115 men to their deaths, while the <i>Neunzer</i> and seven other destroyer escorts&#x2014;helped by planes from the escort carrier <i>Bogue</i>&#x2014;set off on what would prove to be a ten-hour struggle against the submarine that had destroyed her. </p><p>While he unpacked in Bronxville, my father reviewed his role in this event for my mother, then added, with what seemed to me impressive mildness, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s generally considered having been in action.&#x201d; </p><p>MY FATHER TOOK PART in the last great campaign of the Atlantic war. The <i>Neunzer</i> was one of a web of ships stretched across a hundred miles hunting an enemy that naval intelligence had reason to believe was going to launch rocket attacks against American cities. He was in at the end of the longest battle of World War II, indeed, of any war in history. If the Allies had lost that battle, they would have lost the war. </p><p>And yet, my mother&#x2019;s remark was not ludicrous. </p><p>Few people today remember the Atlantic war as a battle, and even at the time only some of those who were in it saw it as a coherent effort. The Pacific was the picturesque war, the one where naval victories took the form we think they should: battleships hammering it out gun to gun, aircraft carriers deciding in a morning the fate of nations. Louis Auchincloss, already a lawyer, soon to be a novelist, but at the time the navigator on an LST (landing ship, tank) remembered, &#x201c;Changing oceans was like changing navies. In the European theater the army and air force were everything; the navy, only a police escort. . . . Never shall I forget my first glimpse of the Pacific navy in the atoll Ulithi where the lines of battleships, cruisers, carriers, and auxiliary vessels seemed to stretch out to the crack of doom.&#x201d; </p><p>Conquer an island; then conquer another island; then sink some battleships. That was a proper sea war. The Atlantic effort by contrast was strange and diffuse, week upon week of boredom endured in constant discomfort, fires on the sea at night and yet nothing there in the morning, eventually the unheroic sight of Halifax through the fog if you were lucky. It was a sea fight whose results were recorded on land. But it began on the first day of the war and ended on the final one, five years and eight months later. In the Pacific, the Battle of Midway broke a Japanese fleet in five minutes. </p><p>But the Allied aim in the Atlantic was not to destroy an enemy on the high seas. It was to keep a delivery system going: to get grain and aviation gas, chocolate and rifles and tires, oil and boots and airplane engines, from America to Europe. The trucks in this operation were merchant ships, some of them ancient, none of them carrying the martial glamour of a PT boat, let alone a cruiser. </p><p>One who did see the high consequence of this dogged chore was Winston Churchill. He said that the U-boat campaign was &#x201c;the only thing that ever really frightened me during the war.&#x201d; While the Atlantic battle was going on, he wrote, &#x201c;How willingly would I have exchanged a full-scale invasion for this shapeless, measureless peril, expressed in charts, curves, and statistics.&#x201d; The charts and statistics showed how many ships the German submarines were sinking, as against how many the Allies could build. It was &#x201c;a war of groping and drowning, of ambuscade and stratagem,&#x201d; said Churchill, &#x201c;of science and seamanship.&#x201d; If the stratagems failed, if the seamanship faltered, Britain would starve and the European fighting fronts would fall to the German army. </p><p>In <i>Commander in Chief</i>, his fine book about the American high command in the war, the historian Eric Larrabee wrote the arresting sentence &#x201c;The Battle of the Atlantic was the war&#x2019;s inner core, an only partly visible axle on which other contingencies turned.&#x201d; That image has stayed with me since I first read it twenty years ago, although I can also see the battle as a vast drill bit or screw, with grooves a week or a month apart, turning and turning through the mortal years, always from America toward Europe, driving convoys eastward. Some of the vessels it carries will get through fifty trips without a scratch; some will burn and sink in front of vacationers on Miami Beach. Sometimes destroyers will protect them; sometimes there won&#x2019;t be enough destroyers to spare for the job; and sometimes the destroyers won&#x2019;t do any good at all, darting this way and that as the U-boats lance into the heart of the convoy and with a torpedo or two turn the months of manufacturing the ammunition and trucks and locomotives and radios and the days of loading them and all the time spent building the vessel that carries this cargo and the lifetimes of raising the crewmen who are attending it into a horrible inanity. </p><p>The battle killed nearly eighty thousand people: drowned them, crushed them, burned them, froze them, starved them in lifeboats. Far beyond the brutal vacancy of ocean that extinguished all those lives, an empire of strenuous ingenuity fizzed and crackled, whole cities running night and day given over to trying to outsmart the slim, dark shapes that Allied seamen so rarely saw. </p><p>It took three nations to end the U-boat campaign&#x2014;the United States, Canada, and Great Britain&#x2014;and Britain&#x2019;s role in the immense task seems better remembered than America&#x2019;s. In some ways this is just; in some, it isn&#x2019;t. </p><p>The particular fight my father was in that April went just the way it should have. This despite the loss of the <i>Frederick C. Davis</i>. By then what Lincoln called the &#x201c;terrible arithmetic of war&#x201d; had established that an American destroyer was a small price to pay for a German submarine. Over the previous four years the U.S. navy had learned a great deal about how to cope with U-boats. Not one ship that took part in this final wide sweep had existed before the war began. I don&#x2019;t just mean the vessels themselves, but the <i>kind</i> of vessels they were. The escort carriers&#x2014;&#x201c;baby flattops&#x201d; that carried a fraction of the number of airplanes that rode in the immense fleet carriers that were going about their famous work in the Pacific&#x2014;had been improvised to meet the crisis, and so had the class of ship my father served on, the destroyer escort, the DE. </p><p>This book tells the story of the American effort in the Battle of the Atlantic. The destroyer escort figures prominently in it because the ship represents a combination of practicality and ingenuity that America brought to the war; and, of course, my father was on one.

Before the war, his only connection with the sea was having ridden across it in ocean liners to study the violin in Paris. Born in 1905, he was old for active duty, and moreover he was married. Yet when the war came he pulled such strings as he could find, and although he had reached the wintry heights of his late thirties, he managed to wangle sea duty.

Just four years later, Barbra Streisand was the top-selling female recording artist in America and the star of one of Broadway&#x2019;s biggest hits. Now the acclaimed Hollywood biographer William Mann chronicles that dizzying ascent, telling the riveting behind-the-scenes story of how Streisand and her team transformed her from an unknown dreamer into a worldwide superstar. <br><br>Drawing on the private papers of Jerome Robbins and Bob Fosse, and interviewing scores of the friends and lovers who knew Barbara before she became Barbra, Mann recreates the vanished world of 1960s New York City and uncovers the truth behind the myths of her formative years. He shows us how <i>Funny Girl</i> was slowly altered, by Fosse and Robbins among others, from a Fanny Brice bio into a star-making vehicle for Streisand; takes us into the clubs and onto the set for her early nightclub and television appearances, including her torch-handing turn with Judy Garland; and introduces the canny marketing team whose strategies made her stardom seem inevitable. The Streisand who emerges is a revelation: a young woman who, for all her tough-skinned ambition, was surprisingly vulnerable in love. <br><br>Everyone who has felt outside the gate, as she once did, remembers a time when the newness and difference of Barbra Streisand changed everything and rewrote all the rules. In <i>Hello, Gorgeous</i>, Mann incisively illuminates the woman before she became the icon and pays tribute to one of the world&#x2019;s most beloved performers.</p><p>HMH hardcover, 2012Previous ISBN: 978-0547368924PRAISE FOR Kate: The Woman Who Was Hepburn<br><br>&#x201c;Thoughtfully examining the differences between the ways Hepburn chose to present herself and the facts of her life . . .

It would be a mistake to treat this as a book for girls only, however, when so many great men--Bourke-White's father, her second husband, several darkroom technicians, and even General Jimmy Doolittle, commander of the 12th Air Force in World War II--figure prominently in it as mentors, teachers, colleagues, and friends. Author Susan Goldman Rubin gracefully deals with sensitive material such as the photographer's shame at discovering that her father was Jewish. And she does a remarkable job of choosing appropriate pictures. As the chief photographer for <i>Life</i> magazine, Bourke-White shot many hugely important but often harsh subjects. Rubin deftly edits these images so that famous photos like the haunting <i>Living Dead of Buchenwald, April, 1945</i> are here, but not such profoundly disturbing ones as Bourke-White's shot of bony corpses stacked for burning. The author underscores the photographer's extraordinary self-confidence as a young woman of huge ambitions and--beginning with Bourke-White's initial flirtation with the soft-focus style of Edward Steichen--delineates the growing power and clarity of her mature documentary style. Bourke-White's life-long interest in science--she kept jars of multilegged fauna on her office bookshelves at <i>Life</i>--is fascinating, and the stories of her wartime adventures--in marooned life rafts, low-flying reconnaissance planes, and torpedoed ships--are frighteningly vivid. <p> The photographs themselves are ultimately given pride of place, in large duotone reproductions that do them ample justice. This book would be right for anyone over 10, and older readers might go on to Sean Callahan's <i>Margaret Bourke-White: Photographer</i>, which is more of a traditional monograph and includes those images that tell truths so painful that Bourke-White herself had great difficulty sorting their negatives. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>This dramatic life story of internationally ac claimed photographer Margaret Bourke-White (1904-1971) traces the accomplishments of a remarkable woman, the first female to make a name for herself as a photojournalist. The book explores her artistic development and chronicles the assignments for Fortune and LIFE magazines that took her all over the world as she fearlessly risked her life to get her story and tell it through pictures. Illustrated with more than 50 of Bourke-White&#39;s black-and-white photographs, and including new research based on interviews with those who knew her, this adventure-packed account will serve as an inspiration for everyone who dreams of realizing a cherished ambition. 56 black-and-white photographs, 96 pages, 933/4 x 10&#34; Advertising: New York Times Book Review Susan Goldman Rubin has written many books for young people, including Abrams&#39; Frank Lloyd Wright.

Like true adventurers, they glory in life&#x2019;s simplest pleasures and natural wonders. But it is Toad, cocky and irrepressible in his goggles and overcoat, whose passion for motorcars represents the free and fearless spirit in all of us; just as it&#x2019;s Toad&#x2019;s downfall that inspires the others to test Grahame&#x2019;s most precious theme&#x2014;the miracle of loyalty and friendship.</p><p>"[Mole] thought his happiness was complete when, as he meandered aimlessly along, suddenly he stood by the edge of a full-fed river. Never in his life had he seen a river before--this sleek, sinuous, full-bodied animal, chasing and chuckling, gripping things with a gurgle and leaving them with a laugh, to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook themselves free, and were caught and held again." Such is the cautious, agreeable Mole's first introduction to the river and the Life Adventurous. Emerging from his home at Mole End one spring, his whole world changes when he hooks up with the good-natured, boat-loving Water Rat, the boastful Toad of Toad Hall, the society- hating Badger who lives in the frightening Wild Wood, and countless other mostly well-meaning creatures. Michael Hague's exquisitely detailed, breathtaking color illustrations on almost every generous spread--along with Kenneth Grahame's elegant, delightfully old-fashioned characterizations of the animals--make this book a wonderful read-aloud.

Fierce and feral, her goshawk Mabel&#39;s temperament mirrors Helen&#39;s own state of grief after her father&#39;s death, and together raptor and human &#34;discover the pain and beauty of being alive&#34; (People). H Is for Hawk is a genre-defying debut from one of our most unique and transcendent voices.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month for March 2015:</strong> When naturalist and falconer Helen Macdonald lost her beloved father, she &#x201c;thought [her] world was ending.&#x201d; Seems apropos, then, that her journey from crippling grief to something resembling grace is on the wings of another deadly bird of prey--the notoriously prickly, and murderous, goshawk. In <i>H Is for Hawk</i>, you will meet Mabel, not your typical bloodthirsty specimen, as she is trained to hunt like the goshawks of yore. It is this brash, slightly mad undertaking that wrenches Macdonald free from despair, and brings her to a place where she can begin again. Doesn&#x2019;t sound like your kind of thing? You&#x2019;d be surprised. Macdonald&#x2019;s gorgeously wrought prose holds you in thrall from the first page, and provides something akin to the escape, and salvation, that nature provides her. In &#x2018;Hawk&#x2019; you will also learn about the famed Arthurian novelist T.H. White, a kindred soul to Macdonald in certain ways.

Collected here are three hundred short meditations by Christian contemplatives from the second to the fourteenth centuries. Many were written by the Desert Fathers, the legendary monks who fled the decadence of city life to dedicate themselves to the life of the spirit in the deserts of Egypt and Palestine. The greatest of these teachers became experienced psychic guides, experts in mapping the stages of spiritual development, who taught and corresponded with disciples from all over Christendom. The meditations are arranged under three traditional headings (1) practice, geared primarily at developing sustained attention and discipline in the beginner; (2) theory, presenting guidance in overcoming obstacles that commonly arise in intermediate stages of spiritual practice; and (3) gnosis, reflections to be shared among the more spiritually advanced. From the <i>Philokalia</i> to Origen to Symeon the New Theologian, these ancient voices speak directly to the soul, as relevant today as they were centuries ago.</p><p><i>The Book of Mystical Chapters</i> wants to slow you down. Its 300 brief meditations, drawn from the writings of the earliest Christian contemplatives, are meant to be read over the course of 300 days. The book's translator and editor, John Anthony McGuckin, explains that this is how early Christian pilgrims learned the wisdom of the Desert Fathers, ascending through three stages of spiritual understanding, from the practical to the transcendent. Pilgrims repeated these meditations until each one broke "like a fruit on the tongue of the monk and revealed its inner flavor to the searching mind." <i>The Book of Mystical Chapters</i> suggests that readers ask of each aphorism, "How have we already experienced it; how could it illuminate a truth about our own heart or the troubles of our friends' hearts or the secret ways that God wishes to develop our seeking soul?" If you're sick of wasting time waiting at the bus stop, waiting between appointments, or waiting to go deeper in faith, maybe this is just the thing for you. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>The early Christian monks of Egypt, Syria, and Palestine were the spiritual heroes of their age&#x2013;fleeing the security of civilization for the desert, where they sought God in lives of prayer, contemplation, and radical simplicity. This book is a portable collection of their teachings, and those of their contemplative contemporaries, ranging from the fourth through the eleventh centuries. It is arranged to the traditional model of three ascending &#x201c;books&#x201d;: <i>Praktikos</i> (practice), <i>Theoretikos</i> (theory), and <i>Gnosis</i> (knowledge). Each book consists of 100 &#x201c;sentences&#x201d;&#x2013;aphorisms or thoughts. Each sentence is intended to be read and meditated upon for an entire day&#x2013;just as the monks themselves might have done as they went about their work.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Trusting God: A Life Without Worry (Women of Faith Study Guide Series)</h2><p><p><i>&#x201c;And those who know Your name will put their trust in You; For You, LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You.&#x201d; Psalm 9:10 (NKJV)</i></p><p><b>Is it possible to live a life without worry?</b></p><p>Worry and stress have a way a sneaking into our lives when we&#x2019;re not looking.

Such is the revelation that launches young Percy Jackson on a quest to help his real father, Poseidon, avert a war among the gods. With the help of Grover the satyr and Annabeth the daughter of Athena, Percy must journey across the United States to catch a thief who has stolen the original weapon of mass destruction - Zeus master bolt. Along the way, they face a host of mythological enemies determined to stop them. Most of all, Percy must come to terms with a father he has never known, and an Oracle that has warned him of betrayal by a friend.</p><p><strong>Rick Riordan</strong> (www.rickriordan.com) is the author of <em>The Kane Chronicles, Book One: The Red Pyramid </em>as well as all the books in the <em>New York Times</em><strong><i> </i></strong>best-selling Percy Jackson and the Olympians series<em>: The Lightning Thief; The Sea of Monsters; The Titan's Curse;</em> <em>The Battle of the Labyrinth</em>; and <em>The Last Olympian</em>.

He lives in Baltimore, Maryland.How could it have taken five years to see a graphic-novel adaptation of such a successful property as the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, and one that, with its heroic destinies and epic action, seems tailor-made to the format? Riordan's original, like Harry Potter as if reimagined by Neil Gaiman, hits all the straightforward archetypes, with young Percy Jackson clued into the secret that he's actually the son of the Greek god Poseidon, then educated at Camp Half-Blood with the other illegitimate demigods before embarking on a hero's journey to stop a war of the Olympians. But Riordan also injected a sense of thorny reality with twists like Percy's good-for-nothing stepfather and the entrance to Hades residing in a soulless Los Angeles. Where the slick and flashy movie version failed, Venditti's sharp-edged writing and Futaki's gritty and unpretentious art capture the same sense of grunge amid the wonder. A timely release that can be recommended with George O'Connor's recent Olympians graphic novels, proving that while five years may seem too long, at least the wait was worth it. Booklist"<br><br>Riordan's highly popular "Olympians" series (Hyperion/Disney) is now a graphic novel. Half-Blood Percy Jackson is the son of a mortal mother and the Greek god Poseidon, which explains why he has always felt out of place among his schoolmates. After learning of his paternity, he is charged with the dangerous mission of locating his Uncle Zeus's missing lightning bolt and returning this symbol of power to its rightful owner. Expert editing keeps the salient parts of the story intact while showcasing the additional storytelling capabilities that the graphic format allows. Excellent panel layout makes the story line easy to follow. The use of angled panels in highly dramatic action scenes is particularly effective. As readers follow Percy's adventures, they are also keenly aware of his personal struggles, as facial expressions help readers to relate to this boy "who doesn't fit in." Illustrations brilliantly illuminate the story, portraying seamless world-blending, from typical school drama and well-known U.S. landmarks to mythological elements. A man seated in one panel casually stands to reveal his true identity as a centaur, the eerie woman seated in the attic is an Oracle, and the Nereid of the undersea kingdom seems a natural part of Percy's world. This blend of mythology and magic with realistic action and adventure brings an added dimension and delightful nuances to this adaptation of the well-known novel. Both ardent followers of Riordan's books and those new to the series will not be disappointed. SLJ"<br><br>Venditti's adaptation of the critically acclaimed first installment of the Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians series faces a daunting challenge: to present a beloved, contemporary, young adult fantasy novel as a 128-page visual narrative. But the team succeeds in spectacular fashion. Venditti (The Surrogates) takes the story of the half-blood Percy--who discovers that he is both the son of a god and the prime suspect in a theft of cosmic implications--and forges an adaptation that does justice not simply to Riordan's story but works perfectly as a graphic novel. The book retains the excellent pacing of the original and gives a face to Riordan's vision of the mythological made modern. Futaki's artwork is exemplary, but what leaves such a lasting impression is Villarrubia's coloring, which reveals both subtlety and spectacle when needed. The graphic novel compression must, of necessity, sacrifice something, namely some of the humor of the original.

But when the Emperor died, Aral suddenly became guardian of the infant heir to the imperial throne of Barrayar - and the target of high-tech assassins in a dynastic civil war that was reminiscent of earth&#39;s Middle Ages, but fought with up-to-the minute biowar technology. Neither Aral nor Cordelia guessed the part that their cell-damaged unborn son would play in Barrayar&#39;s bloody legacy. This edition includes an author&#39;s afterword, and a chronology of the events in the Vorkosigan Saga series. Cover art by Gary Ruddell. **Publisher&#39;s note: Cordelia&#39;s Honor is comprised of two parts: Shards of Honor and Barrayar. Together they form a continuous story following the life of Cordelia Vorkosigan nee Naismith from the day she met her then-enemy Lord Aral Vorkosigan through the boyhood of her son Miles. Barrayar won the 1992 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel of the year, and also the 1992 Locus Poll Award, Best SF Novel. It was also nominated for the 1991 Nebula Award.

For Willard Mayer, a 35-year-old Harvard-educated empirical philosopher, the roots of pro-Communist realpolitiking run deep. A former Princeton professor who was also a member of the Abwehr, Germany's military intelligence service, and an informer for Russia's notorious Internal Affairs Commissariat, the NKVD, Mayer during the war works as an intelligence analyst for the Office of Strategic Services in Washington&#x2014;which remains unaware of his past. En route to Tehran, at Roosevelt's insistence, for the Big Three conference in November 1943 aboard the USS<i> Iowa</i>, Mayer believes he's uncovered a plot to assassinate Joseph Stalin. Meanwhile, Hitler and Himmler, eager to avoid engaging the U.S. in a second European front, are trying to figure out how to get around Roosevelt's demand for an unconditional surrender. The ethically compromised Mayer finds himself in the thick of the negotiations even as larger plots are afoot, including one by an SS general to bomb Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill in Tehran. Kerr is as interested in backdoor diplomatic efforts as he is in espionage and assassination, and this highly entertaining spy fiction also explores the moral quandaries of war and realpolitik. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their small stature earned them fame- and, ironically, ultimately saved their lives. As Hitler&#39;s war descended, the Ovitz family- seven of whom were dwarfs- was plunged into the horrors of the darker moments in modern history. Disembarking from the cattle train into the death camp of Auschwitz, they were separated from other Jewish victims on the orders of one Dr. Joseph Mengele, the &#34;Angel of Death,&#34; Obsessed with eugenics, Dr. Mengele carried out a series of loathsome experiments on the family and developed a disturbing fondness for his human lab rats, so much so that when the Russian army liberated Auschwitz, all members of the family- the youngest, a baby boy just 18 months old; the oldest, a 58-year-old woman-were still alive.

Visceral sensations, she finds, are vital to this process, which yields a new animism in which humans and "the environment" become thoroughly entangled. In case studies on food, water, energy, and climate from the United States, India, and Japan, Weston approaches the new animism as both a symptom of our times and an analytic with the potential to open paths to new and forgotten ways of living.</p><p>Kath Weston is Professor of Anthropology at the University of Virginia.

It was on <i>Daredevil</i> that Miller gained notoriety, honed his storytelling abilities, and took his first steps toward becoming a giant in the comics medium. After <i>Daredevil</i> came <i>Ronin,</i> a science-fiction samurai drama that seamlessly melded Japanese and French comics traditions into the American mainstream; and after that, the groundbreaking and acclaimed <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</i> and <i>Batman: Year One</i>, both of which not only redefined the classic character, but also revitalized the industry itself. Finally able to fulfill his dream of doing an all-out, straight-ahead crime series, Miller introduced <i>Sin City</i> in 1991. Readers responded enthusiastically to Miller's tough-as-leather noir drama, creating an instant sales success. His multi-award-winning <i>300</i> series from Dark Horse, a telling of history's most glorious and underreported battle, was brought to full-blooded life in 1998. In 2001, Miller returned to the superhero genre with the bestselling <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again</i>. Frank Miller continues to push the medium into new territories, exploring subject matter previously untouched in comics, and his work consistently receives the highest praise from his industry peers and readers everywhere. In 2005, with the hugely successful <i>Sin City</i> movie release, codirected with Robert Rodriguez, Miller added a director's credit to his already impressive r�sum� and introduced his characters to an entirely new legion of fans worldwide.</p><h2>Daily Life During the Holocaust</h2><p><p>The Holocaust was a complex and horrifying experience that affected millions of people in Europe. The nearly 13 years of Nazi rule had an enormous influence on the day-to-day existence of people in every walk of life: Jews and non-Jews, perpetrators and rescuers, collaborators and resisters, officials and ordinary citizens. Nearly all of Europe's Jews were victims. Students, teachers, and interested readers can explore how the daily lives of these victims, despite their heroic efforts to survive and maintain a normal existence, became increasingly untenable and for most eventually ended in death. Along with the often harrowing details of life under the Nazis, emphasis is placed on uplifting accounts of resistance and the role of rescuers.</p><p></p><p>Accounts from survivors whose testimonies have never been published provide powerful insight into the devastating effects Nazi rule had on people's lives. In addition to the Jews, significant numbers of others&#x2015;Gypsies, clergy who protested or protected victims, Communists, Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals, the mentally ill and handicapped, and others&#x2015;were persecuted, and their stories are also noted. Soumerai, a survivor herself, interweaves her painful recollections throughout the text to provide a unique perspective on the historical events described. Readers will learn how aspects of everyday living became symbols of resistance for many of the victims: educating their children, practicing their religion, eating and drinking, and maintaining personal hygiene took on new significance. More than 30 photographs further illuminate these experiences.</p></p><p><p>Experience and explore the horrific and devastating effects that the Holocaust had on everyday lives through the voices of the people who endured it.</p><p>EVE NUSSBAUM SOUMERAI is an author, lecturer, teacher, and Holocaust survivor.

This time, with Jury off in Ireland, Plant takes the starring role. His vacation in picturesque Bletchley on the Cornwall coast is very nearly ruined by the coincidental appearance of his dreaded Aunt Agatha. Ironically, however, he is drawn to the plight of a young man, Johnny Wells, whose favorite aunt has disappeared suddenly without trace. In spite of Agatha, Plant decides to lease a house owned by an American millionaire whose two grandchildren died tragically on the beach a few years before. Within a day or so, a new dead body is found in neighboring Lamorna: that of Sada Colthorp, a young woman who had lived in the area but left to dabble in porn movies. Plant and divisional police commander Brian Macalvie (<i>Help the Poor Struggler</i>) believes there's a link between Colthorp and the missing Chris Wells. When the pieces start to come together (and a fast string of violence ensues), Jury makes a token appearance to tie up the remaining loose ends. But the day really belongs to Plant, who is becoming much more than an accidental detective, and to Macalvie, a character with an appeal that may eclipse even Jury's.<p> As always, Grimes provides comic relief at the expense of a tight plot by checking in with the myriad other characters who populate Plant's Long Piddleton and Jury's London. The impatient reader may wonder when, if ever, Plant and friends will cease their juvenile heckling of Vivian Rivington's Italian count. The final explanation of the children's deaths, however, will leave the most stoic mystery fan feeling distinctly queasy. That Grimes can so effectively amuse, shock, intrigue, and even irritate after 16 books bodes well for the continuing life of the series. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>Scotland Yard Superintendent Richard Jury returns -- but not before sidekick Melrose Plant finds himself embroiled in a haunting case of murder past and present.<p>With his good friend Richard Jury on a fool's errand in Northern Ireland, Melrose Plant tries -- in vain -- to escape his aunt and his Long Piddleton lethargy by fleeing to Cornwall. There, high on a rocky promontory overlooking the sea, he rents a house -- one furnished with tragic memories. But his Cornwallian reveries are tempered by the local waiter/cab driver/amateur magician. The industrious Johnny Wells seems unflappable -- until his beloved aunt disappears. Now, Plant is dragged into the disturbing pasts of everyone involved -- and a murder mystery that only Richard Jury can solve....</p></p><h2>Merchant Princes (Company of Adventurers)</h2><p>Traces the history of the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company from the second half of the nineteenth century and the reign of Donald Alexander Smith to the company&#39;s contemporary machinations</p><p>The final volume in Newman's three-part engrossing and epic record (1985, 1987) of how the Hudson's Bay Co. helped shape Canadian history as a royally chartered (in 1670) instrument of British empire. Here, Newman covers the 120-odd years through mid- 1991, during which HBC devolved into the Dominion's largest department-store chain. As before, the author again focuses on larger-than-life personalities who played major roles in the corporate drama. Among them are the rascally, self-serving Donald Alexander Smith, a longtime governor of HBC, as well as Kenneth (Lord) Thomson, the miserly heir to a newspaper/petroleum fortune who gained control of ``The Bay'' (as it's known up north) in 1979. Between the polar- opposite regimes of these two, Newman tracks HBC's expansion into the Arctic, the subsequent decline of the mainstay fur trade, and the boardroom battles that resulted in the shift of HBC's legal domicile from London to Winnipeg on the 300th anniversary of its founding. Along the way, he offers a wealth of anecdotal detail on The Bay's abortive involvements in filmmaking (37 features), wartime shipping (110 vessels sunk by German subs), bootlegging, and allied ventures that yielded few returns for investors. But despite its proving less than a financial success for backers over the years, HBC, Newman insists, has contributed immeasurably to the making of Canada's character--for instance, in the way the company's hinterland outposts established enduring commercial ties with the aboriginal inhabitants, stressing collective survival. By contrast, the author argues, fiercely independent individuals with little sense of community conquered America's frontier with shot and shell, slaughtering Indians for their furs or just to ``watch 'em spin.'' Newman concludes that the HBC has suffered irretrievable loss from the Faustian survival bargain that obliged it to exchange a many-splendored heritage for a mess of merchandising pottage. Absorbing and praiseworthy. The elegantly written text is profusely illustrated. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The third century of Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) was marked by an expansion into the Arctic followed by a slow transition from a fur trading company into Canada's leading retailer. Newman details these changes and the personalities behind them in his final volume on the history of the HBC, which brings the story up to 1991 and includes a discussion of the sale of the northern stores and fur trade divisions in 1987. As with the previous volumes ( LJ 12/85, 12/87), Newman presents a solid analysis based on extensive research and, in this case, interviews with some of the principals involved, and he delivers it with his usual straightforward, readable style. Merchant Princes forms a magnificent conclusion to the three-volume saga and will be of interest to business historians as well as readers interested in the fur trade and Canada. Taken together, the whole of the three volumes is greater than the sum of the parts--they should stand as the standard account of the HBC for decades to come. The set is essential for academic libraries and strongly recommended for public libraries.<br><i>- Stephen H. Peters, Northern Michigan Univ.

We think we communicate with words, but has anyone ever told that to an Italian? Where did the expression &#34;tongue-tied&#34; come from? No one ever tied a tongue. But tie their hands and about half the world&#39;s communicators would be silenced. The human (and sometimes non-human) hands are, with the possible exception of the eyes, the most expressive parts of the body, asking for more or less, telling us to come or to go, asking questions and answering them, scolding, rewarding, searching and finding, and, at their most intimate, loving and lustful. Hands reward us, calm us, feed us, and scratch our backs. They intimidate, bless, encourage, and stop us. They soothe, caress, and sometimes go where they shouldn&#39;t. We may take hands for granted. But Elliott Erwitt does not. Here is Erwitt at his most serious-and-yet-whimsical best, giving us the moments which, without hands, would not exist. 100 duotone images.</p><p><b>Elliott Erwitt</b>'s photographs have been defining our experiences and making us laugh for more than half a century. They are in private and major museum collections throughout the world. A member of Magnum, the prestigious photo-cooperative, Erwitt has published a dozen books including <i>Personal Exposures</i> and, most recently, <i>Snaps</i>.In introducing this album of black-and-white photographs, Charles Flowers cites an anthropologist's contention that 60 percent of communication is nonverbal, and most of that is done with the hands. Flowers also says no one lacks an opinion about his or her hands, investing them with as much personality as the face. Those and other notions Flowers plants induce greater-than-usual consciousness of the implications of these 100-plus images. The adult hands securing a little child's swimsuit appear full of everyday love, while the hand of a man fingering the waist of a woman's bikini bottom first implies penny-ante lust, then, perhaps, pestering, or maybe grooming. The same gesture--hand to forehead as if supporting a heavy mind--reads as weariness in an aged nun, as penitence in an old man seated by what seems to be a sermonizing preacher. That such involving, information-rich interpretations arise so readily is a testament to Erwitt's mastery of selection, composition, focus, and lighting. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Though these are fundamental questions they often go unanswered in our current evangelical context. Far too many pastors and thinkers celebrate the trappings of faith and the mere benefits of Christianity, ignoring the biblical testimony on true conversion that shouts from countless texts from Scripture.<br><br>This has fed an age-old problem: nominal Christianity. Though Edwards is sometimes presented as a scourge, a mean-hearted parson who lived to belt out thunderous damnations, a careful study of the historical record and of Edwards&#x2019; writings shows that he was in fact a Christian man devoted to the cultivation of true and saving faith in a spiritually fickle people he tenaciously loved.<br><br>The problem of noncommittal Christianity did not end with Edwards. It not only survives but thrives in the current day. In studying it then, we are studying ourselves. We see that nominal Christianity, a considerable challenge today, has historic roots. We need not face this problem alone, growing more discouraged by the day, flailing as we try method after method to address the problem.

But being educated by photographs is not like being educated by older, more artisanal images. For one thing, there are a great many more images around, claiming our attention. The inventory started in 1839 and since then just about everything has been photographed, or so it seems. This very insatiability of the photographing eye changes the terms of confinement in the cave, our world. In teaching us a new visual code, photographs alter and enlarge our notions of what is worth looking at and what we have a right to observe. They are a grammar and, even more importantly, an ethics of seeing. Finally, the most grandiose result of the photographic enterprise is to give us the sense that we can hold the whole world in our heads--as an anthology of images. To collect photographs is to collect the world. Movies and television programs light up walls, flicker, and go out; but with still photographs the image is also an object, light-weight, cheap to produce, easy to carry about, accumulate, store. In Godard's <i>Les Carabiniers</i> (1963), two sluggish lumpen-peasants are lured into joining the King's Army by the promise that they will be able to loot, rape, kill, or do whatever else they please to the enemy, and get rich. But the suitcase of booty that Michel-Ange and Ulysse triumphantly bring home, years later, to their wives turns out to contain only picture postcards, hundreds of them, of Monuments, Department Stores, Mammals, Wonders of Nature, Methods of Transport, Works of Art, and other classified treasures from around the globe. Godard's gag vividly parodies the equivocal magic of the photographic image. Photographs are perhaps the most mysterious of all the objects that make up, and thicken, the environment we recognize as modern. Photographs really are experience captured, andthe camera is the ideal arm of consciousness in its acquisitive mood. To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. It means putting oneself into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge--and, therefore, like power. A now notorious first fall into alienation, habituating people to abstract the world into printed words, is supposed to have engendered that surplus of Faustian energy and psychic damage needed to build modern, inorganic societies. But print seems a less treacherous form of leaching out the world, of turning it into a mental object, than photographic images, which now provide most of the knowledge people have about the look of the past and the reach of the present. What is written about a person or an event is frankly an interpretation, as are handmade visual statements, like paintings and drawings. Photographed images do not seem to be statements about the world so much as pieces of it, miniatures of reality that anyone can make or acquire. Photographs, which fiddle with the scale of the world, themselves get reduced, blown up, cropped, retouched, doctored, tricked out. They age, plagued by the usual ills of paper objects; they disappear; they become valuable, and get bought and sold; they are reproduced. Photographs, which package the world, seem to invite packaging. They are stuck in albums, framed and set on tables, tacked on walls, projected as slides. Newspapers and magazines feature them; cops alphabetize them; museums exhibit them; publishers compile them. For many decades the book has been the most influential way of arranging (and usually miniaturizing) photographs, thereby guaranteeing them longevity, if not immortality--photographs are fragile objects, easily torn or mislaid--anda wider public. The photograph in a book is, obviously, the image of an image. But since it is, to begin with, a printed, smooth object, a photograph loses much less of its essential quality when reproduced in a book than a painting does. Still, the book is not a wholly satisfactory scheme for putting groups of photographs into general circulation. The sequence in which the photographs are to be looked at is proposed by the order of pages, but nothing holds readers to the recommended order or indicates the amount of time to be spent on each photograph. Chris Marker's film, <i>Si</i> <i>j'avais quatre dromadaires</i> (1966), a brilliantly orchestrated meditation on photographs of all sorts and themes, suggests a subtler and more rigorous way of packaging (and enlarging) still photographs. Both the order and the exact time for looking at each photograph are imposed; and there is a gain in visual legibility and emotional impact. But photographs transcribed in a film cease to be collectable objects, as they still are when served up in books. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> <i></i>Photographs furnish evidence. Something we hear about, but doubt, seems proven when we're shown a photograph of it. In one version of its utility, the camera record incriminates. Starting with their use by the Paris police in the murderous roundup of Communards in June 1871, photographs became a useful tool of modern states in the surveillance and control of their increasingly mobile populations. In another version of its utility, the camera record justifies. A photograph passes for incontrovertible proof that a given thing happened. The picture may distort; but there is always a presumption that something exists, or did exist, which is like what's in the picture. Whatever the limitations(through amateurism) or pretensions (through artistry) of the individual photographer, a photograph--any photograph--seems to have a more innocent, and therefore more accurate, relation to visible reality than do other mimetic objects. Virtuosi of the noble image like Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand, composing mighty, unforgettable photographs decade after decade, still want, first of all, to show something "out there," just like the Polaroid owner for whom photographs are a handy, fast form of note-taking, or the shutterbug with a Brownie who takes snapshots as souvenirs of daily life. While a painting or a prose description can never be other than a narrowly selective interpretation, a photograph can be treated as a narrowly selective transparency. But despite the presumption of veracity that gives all photographs authority, interest, seductiveness, the work that photographers do is no generic exception to the usually shady commerce between art and truth. Even when photographers are most concerned with mirroring reality, they are still haunted by tacit imperatives of taste and conscience. The immensely gifted members of the Farm Security Administration photographic project of the late 1930s (among them Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Ben Shahn, Russell Lee) would take dozens of frontal pictures of one of their sharecropper subjects until satisfied that they had gotten just the right look on film--the precise expression on the subject's face that supported their own notions about poverty, light, dignity, texture, exploitation, and geometry. In deciding how a picture should look, in preferring one exposure to another, photographers are always imposing standards on their subjects. Although there is a sense in which the camera does indeed capture reality, not just interpret it, photographs areas much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are. Those occasions when the taking of photographs is relatively undiscriminating, promiscuous, or self-effacing do not lessen the didacticism of the whole enterprise. This very passivity--and ubiquity--of the photographic record is photography's "message," its aggression. Images which idealize (like most fashion and animal photography) are no less aggressive than work which makes a virtue of plainness (like class pictures, still lifes of the bleaker sort, and mug shots). There is an aggression implicit in every use of the camera. This is as evident in the 1840s and 1850s, photography's glorious first two decades, as in all the succeeding decades, during which technology made possible an ever increasing spread of that mentality which looks at the world as a set of potential photographs. Even for such early masters as David Octavius Hill and Julia Margaret Cameron who used the camera as a means of getting painterly images, the point of taking photographs was a vast departure from the aims of painters. From its start, photography implied the capture of the largest possible number of subjects. Painting never had so imperial a scope. The subsequent industrialization of camera technology only carried out a promise inherent in photography from its very beginning: to democratize all experiences by translating them into images. That age when taking photographs required a cumbersome and expensive contraption--the toy of the clever, the wealthy, and the obsessed--seems remote indeed from the era of sleek pocket cameras that invite anyone to take pictures. The first cameras, made in France and England in the early 1840s, had only inventors and buffs to operate them. Since there were then no professional photographers, there could not be amateurs either, and taking photographs hadno clear social use; it was a gratuitous, that is, an artistic activity, though with few pretensions to being an art. It was only with its industrialization that photography came into its own as art. As industrialization provided social uses for the operations of the photographer, so the reaction against these uses reinforced the self-consciousness of photography-as-art. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> <i></i>Recently, photography has become almost as widely practiced an amusement as sex and dancing--which means that, like every mass art form, photography is not practiced by most people as an art. It is mainly a social rite, a defense against anxiety, and a tool of power. Memorializing the achievements of individuals considered as members of families (as well as of other groups) is the earliest popular use of photography. For at least a century, the wedding photograph has been as much a part of the ceremony as the prescribed verbal formulas. Cameras go with family life. According to a sociological study done in France, most households have a camera, but a household with children is twice as likely to have at least one camera as a household in which there are no children. Not to take pictures of one's children, particularly when they are small, is a sign of parental indifference, just as not turning up for one's graduation picture is a gesture of adolescent rebellion. Through photographs, each family constructs a portrait-chronicle of itself--a portable kit of images that bears witness to its connectedness. It hardly matters what activities are photographed so long as photographs get taken and are cherished. Photography becomes a rite of family life just when, in the industrializing countries of Europe and America, the very institution of the family starts undergoing radicalsurgery. As that claustrophobic unit, the nuclear family, was being carved out of a much larger family aggregate, photography came along to memorialize, to restate symbolically, the imperiled continuity and vanishing extendedness of family life. Those ghostly traces, photographs, supply the token presence of the dispersed relatives. A family's photograph album is generally about the extended family--and, often, is all that remains of it. As photographs give people an imaginary possession of a past that is unreal, they also help people to take possession of space in which they are insecure. Thus, photography develops in tandem with one of the most characteristic of modern activities: tourism. For the first time in history, large numbers of people regularly travel out of their habitual environments for short periods of time. It seems positively unnatural to travel for pleasure without taking a camera along. Photographs will offer indisputable evidence that the trip was made, that the program was carried out, that fun was had. Photographs document sequences of consumption carried on outside the view of family, friends, neighbors. But dependence on the camera, as the device that makes real what one is experiencing, doesn't fade when people travel more. Taking photographs fills the same need for the cosmopolitans accumulating photograph-trophies of their boat trip up the Albert Nile or their fourteen days in China as it does for lower-middle-class vacationers taking snapshots of the Eiffel Tower or Niagara Falls. A way of certifying experience, taking photographs is also a way of refusing it--by limiting experience to a search for the photogenic, by converting experience into an image, a souvenir. Travel becomes a strategy for accumulating photographs. The very activity of taking pictures is soothing, and assuages general feelings of disorientation that are likely tobe exacerbated by travel. Most tourists feel compelled to put the camera between themselves and whatever is remarkable that they encounter. Unsure of other responses, they take a picture. This gives shape to experience: stop, take a photograph, and move on. The method especially appeals to people handicapped by a ruthless work ethic--Germans, Japanese, and Americans. Using a camera appeases the anxiety which the work-driven feel about not working when they are on vacation and supposed to be having fun. They have something to do that is like a friendly imitation of work: they can take pictures. People robbed of their past seem to make the most fervent picture takers, at home and abroad. Everyone who lives in an industrialized society is obliged gradually to give up the past, but in certain countries, such as the United States and Japan, the break with the past has been particularly traumatic. In the early 1970s, the fable of the brash American tourist of the 1950s and 1960s, rich with dollars and Babbittry, was replaced by the mystery of the group-minded Japanese tourist, newly released from his island prison by the miracle of overvalued yen, who is generally armed with two cameras, one on each hip. Photography has become one of the principal devices for experiencing something, for giving an appearance of participation. One full-page ad shows a small group of people standing pressed together, peering out of the photograph, all but one looking stunned, excited, upset. The one who wears a different expression holds a camera to his eye; he seems self-possessed, is almost smiling. While the others are passive, clearly alarmed spectators, having a camera has transformed one person into something active, a voyeur: only he has mastered the situation. What do these people see? Wedon't know. And it doesn't matter. It is an Event: something worth seeing--and therefore worth photographing. The ad copy, white letters across the dark lower third of the photograph like news coming over a teletype machine, consists of just six words: " ... Prague ... Woodstock ... Vietnam ... Sapporo ... Londonderry ... LEICA." Crushed hopes, youth antics, colonial wars, and winter sports are alike--are equalized by the camera. Taking photographs has set up a chronic voyeuristic relation to the world which levels the meaning of all events. A photograph is not just the result of an encounter between an event and a photographer; picture-taking is an event in itself, and one with ever more peremptory rights--to interfere with, to invade, or to ignore whatever is going on. Our very sense of situation is now articulated by the camera's interventions. The omnipresence of cameras persuasively suggests that time consists of interesting events, events worth photographing. This, in turn, makes it easy to feel that any event, once underway, and whatever its moral character, should be allowed to complete itself--so that something else can be brought into the world, the photograph. After the event has ended, th...</p><h2>The Last Kind Word: A McKenzie Novel (Twin Cities P.I.

He lives in St. Paul, Minnesota.</p>ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The handcuffs weren&#x2019;t particularly tight, yet they pinned my arms behind my back, making it impossible to get comfortable. Eventually I was able to maneuver until one shoulder was leaning against the rear door of the deputy&#x2019;s patrol car, the other rested against the back of the seat, and my hands hung in the cramped space between them. I wiggled my butt, but it didn&#x2019;t help. The seat was made of hard vinyl so that it could be easily cleaned&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t meant to be cushy. My fellow prisoner, his hands also cuffed behind his back, balanced on the edge of the seat and stared straight ahead with glassy and unseeing eyes. He looked walking-dead drunk. However, since he had spent the past few days in the Ramsey County jail being interrogated by FBI and ATF agents, I was betting on mild shock. <br>I turned my head to look out the window and watched a chunk of real estate whiz past, mostly forest. We weren&#x2019;t in the North Woods of Minnesota quite yet, although we were headed that way. <br>&#x201c;Deputy,&#x201d; I said. He glanced at me through his rearview mirror. &#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d; <br>His smile made me think he used one of those teeth whiteners advertised on TV. <br>&#x201c;What do you care, Dyson?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Got somewhere you need to be?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Humor me,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;Eleven thirty-five.&#x201d; <br>I continued staring out the window. <br> <i>She&#x2019;s late,</i> my inner voice told me. <br>I have a thing about punctuality, which means I spend a lot of time being annoyed. Waiting makes me grumpy if not downright angry, depending on whom I&#x2019;m waiting for and how long. Nina says if I were less prompt myself I&#x2019;d be a more agreeable companion. I suppose there&#x2019;s something to that. On the other hand, if you say you&#x2019;re going to be in a specific place at a specific time, then you should damn well be there. If I were wearing a watch, I&#x2019;d be tapping the face with my finger by now. Only I had no personal possessions on me at all&#x2014;just the orange short-sleeve jail scrubs and a pair of ill-fitting canvas tennis shoes furnished by the Ramsey County Detention Center. <br>I glanced at my fellow prisoner while pretending not to. He leaned forward until his head was pressed against the steel mesh curtain that separated the backseat from the front. He was muttering to himself. &#x201c;Going to prison&nbsp;&#x2026; never let us out&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You say something?&#x201d; the deputy asked. <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Skarda said&#x2014;that was his name, David Skarda. We had never met; still, I knew everything about him. For one thing, I knew he wasn&#x2019;t actually headed for prison, at least not yet. He was merely being transferred from one pretrial lockup to another&#x2014;he was going to be tried in Grand Rapids, about 180 miles north of the Twin Cities, since he committed his armed robbery in Itasca County. He had originally been conveyed to the Ramsey County jail in St. Paul after he was apprehended as a convenience to the ATF and the FBI, which wanted to question him about the gun he was carrying at the time of his arrest. If he had been smart, he would have told them everything he knew. But he wasn&#x2019;t and he didn&#x2019;t. <br>Deputy Ken Olson&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to know his name, either, yet I did&#x2014;drove effortlessly, like a man who had spent many hours behind the wheel. We followed U.S. Highway 169 as it hugged Lake Mille Lacs going north. There were far better, faster routes that led from the Cities to Grand Rapids, yet none of them was as scenic. And none of them narrowed to a single lane in just the right spot. <br>&#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d; I asked again. <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; Olson said. <br>&#x201c;Lunch. I hear they serve a nice buffet in the Itasca County jail.&#x201d; <br>The deputy thought that was funny. &#x201c;Relax,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;Relax, relax,&#x201d; Skarda muttered. <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; The deputy spoke while watching the action unfold through his rearview. A red Honda Accord came up fast until it was hard on his bumper, swung wide despite the double yellow line, and passed him on the left. He laughed as it pulled ahead. <br>&#x201c;A blonde,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Some blond bimbo driving. Who else would be dumb enough to pass a police car illegally, and look at this&#x2014;she&#x2019;s going fifteen miles over the speed limit. If it weren&#x2019;t for you two, I&#x2019;d have me some fun.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mind us,&#x201d; I said. <br>A moment later I could feel the car surge forward. Itasca County was in the process of retiring its fleet of Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors in favor of the more economical Dodge Charger the deputy was driving&#x2014;if he had put the pedal to the metal, as the cowboys say, there would have been no contest. I saw Olson&#x2019;s eyes flicker down and to his right, and for a moment I thought he might be running the blonde&#x2019;s license plate on his onboard laptop. But then he sighed deeply, the Charger slowed, and he brought his full attention back to the road. <br>&#x201c;Protocols,&#x201d; Olson said. He spoke as if it were the saddest word in the English language. <br>The Accord followed the highway into a sweeping curve and disappeared from view. A few seconds later, however, we caught up to it. The red car was fishtailing in the lane, and my first thought was that it blew a tire and the driver was trying to bring it back under control. The red taillights flared, and the car pulled to the side of the road and stopped, its nose on the shoulder, its rear on the highway, blocking us. The deputy brought the Charger to a halt several car lengths behind the Accord and watched intently. <br>&#x201c;What the hell is she doing?&#x201d; he asked. <br>Forget what you&#x2019;ve seen on TV and in the movies about inattentive guards who regularly ignore barking dogs; sudden, unexplained noises; and the odd behavior of complete strangers. In reality, most are trained to react&#x2014;hell, overreact&#x2014;to anything out of the ordinary, and they are never, ever taken out by a single punch or karate chop. The deputy, however, wasn&#x2019;t one of them. When the blonde stepped out of the Accord he smiled brightly, showing all his teeth. I didn&#x2019;t blame him. She was wearing the longest hair, shortest skirt, and highest heels I had ever seen. She tottered toward us, carrying a highway map that hid her chest. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to be kidding me,&#x201d; Olson said. He put the Charger in park, opened his door, and slid out. &#x201c;Lady, what are you thinking?&#x201d; <br>The lady dropped the map. She was carrying an M26 Taser gun. She squeezed the trigger and two barbed electrodes exploded from the bright green nose, imbedding themselves into the deputy&#x2019;s chest and flooding his body with 50,000 volts, all before the map fluttered to the ground. The deputy&#x2019;s muscles locked up. He fell to the pavement like a square of shingles tossed from the roof of a two-story house. <br>The woman dropped the Taser, kicked off her heels, and went quickly to the deputy&#x2019;s side. She squatted next to him, her short skirt riding up high on her thighs, and searched his pockets for the key to the handcuffs. She took the key, removed the Glock from the deputy&#x2019;s holster, and padded purposely in bare feet to the Charger, where she found the latch that unlocked the back door. She moved as if every step had been carefully choreographed. <br>I slid out of the backseat and turned around. The woman unlocked the cuffs and gave me both the key and the Glock. I shoved the Glock between the waistband of my scrubs and the small of my back and followed her to the deputy. Olson was just starting to regain his senses as I cuffed his wrists behind his back. He said, &#x201c;Huh, what?&#x201d; while the woman and I dragged him to the patrol car. <br>&#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; Skarda wanted to know. His mood had switched from depressed to manic just like that. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on? Is this an escape? Are you trying to escape?&#x201d; His eyes were bright with the possibility even as he flattened against the far door. &#x201c;Take me with you.&#x201d; <br>We ignored him, shoving the deputy inside; Skarda swung his legs up and away to give us room. The deputy shook off our hands and turned painfully until both his knees were planted on the floor of the car and his torso was folded over the backseat. His forehead was pressed against the hard vinyl as if he were using it to push himself upright. <br>&#x201c;Stop this, stop it right now,&#x201d; Olson said. <br>I slammed the door shut. <br>&#x201c;Luck,&#x201d; the woman said. <br>It was the only word she had spoken during the seconds&#x2014;yes, seconds&#x2014;it took to disarm the deputy. She gathered her shoes and ran to the Honda Accord. A moment later, she was motoring down the highway at a speed that invited arrest. <br>I slid behind the wheel of the Charger, shut the door, and put the vehicle in gear. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never get away with this, Dyson,&#x201d; the deputy said. His voice was hoarse and low. <br>&#x201c;What did you say?&#x201d; I asked. I accelerated down Highway 169 until I was going the speed limit and then set the cruise control. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never get away with this.&#x201d; This time he was shouting. <br>&#x201c;I bet you say that to all the escaping prisoners,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;Do you think the police are asleep up here? You think they don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re doing?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, actually, they don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m doing. That&#x2019;s why I took your car instead of hightailing it with the babe in the red Accord, so some citizen wouldn&#x2019;t see you parked in the middle of the highway and call it in. Time is my friend. It&#x2019;ll be hours before the county sheriff knows what happened, and by then I will be far away from here.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;This car is equipped with a GPS tracking device.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It is?&#x201d; Skarda asked. <br>&#x201c;Cops want to make sure they can recover their vehicles if they&#x2019;re stolen,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Did you know some guys started a cab company in Detroit a while back using nothing but stolen police cars? God&#x2019;s truth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Dyson, listen to me,&#x201d; Deputy Olson said. &#x201c;We can still work this out. It&#x2019;s not too late.&#x201d; <br>I glanced at him through the rearview mirror and smiled. &#x201c;Of course it is,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;Goddammit!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hey, hey, hey&#x2014;use your indoor voice.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What about me?&#x201d; Skarda asked. <br>&#x201c;What about you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Take me with you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The plan is for one.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then, then you can, you can just let me go.&#x201d; <br>I shook my head slowly. &#x201c;The cops&#x2019;ll pick you up in about ten minutes, and then you&#x2019;ll be screwed even worse than you are now. Isn&#x2019;t that right, Deputy?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;Believe it or not, I&#x2019;m doing you a favor,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pay you,&#x201d; Skarda said. <br>&#x201c;Pay me what?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Fifty thousand dollars.&#x201d; <br>That made me turn in my seat. I stared at him briefly through the steel mesh before returning my eyes to the road. <br>&#x201c;Where would a punk like you get fifty thousand dollars?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s my business,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;Fifty thousand dollars.&#x201d; I said it as if the number impressed me. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; I asked, even though I already knew the answer. <br>&#x201c;Dave Skarda.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What did they bust you for?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Armed robbery.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Armed robbery,&#x201d; I repeated slowly. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t ask if you have the money on you&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, no.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Where is it?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My gang. Deliver me to my gang and they&#x2019;ll pay you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your gang?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;My crew.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Uh-huh. Whaddaya think, Deputy? Think Dave here has a crew?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s a wannabe gangster who&#x2019;s going to spend the rest of his life in Stillwater State Correctional Facility if he steps one foot out of this car.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hear that, Dave? Best keep your seat.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Bullshit.&#x201d; He said the word as if he had invented it. &#x201c;Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. I&#x2019;m not messing with you, Dyson. Fifty thousand dollars. On delivery. You have my word.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do this, Skarda,&#x201d; the deputy said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll only be worse for you later.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Shut up, just shut up,&#x201d; Skarda said. &#x201c;Fifty thousand dollars, Dyson. I promise.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If I take your word and you don&#x2019;t keep it&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re lying you better say so now and no harm done cuz later&#x2019;s going to be too late.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not lying. Trust me.&#x201d; <br>Whenever anyone says &#x201c;trust me&#x201d; I automatically think the opposite, but I didn&#x2019;t tell Skarda that. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Okay. It&#x2019;s always good to have a Plan B.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It means&#x2014;just be quiet for a while. Both you kids, be quiet. Daddy needs to think.&#x201d; <br>While I was thinking I maneuvered the patrol car north on 169 until it intersected Minnesota Highway 18 and I went east. Traffic was not heavy. It was June in Minnesota, and you usually get an inordinate number of city dwellers heading to lake cabins and other getaways &#x201c;Up North.&#x201d; But it was also early afternoon on a Wednesday. I followed 18 until it merged with Highway 47 and I went south, effectively driving around the northern half of the enormous Lake Mille Lacs, where I had often fished for walleye. It was a pleasant drive, and I probably would have enjoyed it if I weren&#x2019;t on the run. Eventually 18 and 47 forked and I went east again. That&#x2019;s when the radio came alive. The signal was surprisingly strong and clear. <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one,&#x201d; a voice said. <br>It was the patrol car&#x2019;s call sign. I heard the deputy use it when he cleared St. Paul. <br>&#x201c;Hey, Dave,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Keep the deputy quiet for a minute.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one,&#x201d; the voice repeated. <br>I took the microphone from its holster and spoke into it. <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one, go.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one, what&#x2019;s your twenty?&#x201d; <br>Before I could click the SEND button and reply, Olson started screaming, &#x201c;Ten-ninety-eight, ten-ninety-eight, officer needs assistance.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Dammit, Skarda, what did I say?&#x201d; <br>Skarda used his legs to brace himself against the door and then lunged to his side so that his elbows and shoulders fell on top of the deputy&#x2019;s head. The deputy screamed again, but this time Skarda&#x2019;s body muffled his voice. <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one, say again,&#x201d; the voice said over the radio. <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;Sorry &#x2019;bout that. I&#x2019;m north on U.S. 169, just shy of State 210.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one, running a little late, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one, there was some traffic in Aitkin.&#x201d; <br>There was more muffled shouting from the backseat. <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one, are you sure you didn&#x2019;t stop for a beer?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one, I thought I&#x2019;d wait until I got closer to home.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one, what&#x2019;s your ten-seventy-seven?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one, ETA is one hour.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one, copy.&#x201d; <br>I took a deep breath and returned the microphone to its holster. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; I said. <br>Skarda managed to roll off the deputy and sit up again. <br>The deputy sputtered his anger. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re screwed, Skarda,&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to have your head on a plate.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You have to take me with, now,&#x201d; Skarda said. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; I told him. <br>&#x201c;What does ten-ninety-eight mean, anyway?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Standard police code. It means prison break in progress.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You two are totally fucked,&#x201d; the deputy said. <br>&#x201c;I believe the basic code for that is ten-forty-five-F.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Less than an hour later we crossed Interstate 35, still heading east. <br>&#x201c;My friends are up north,&#x201d; Skarda said. <br>&#x201c;Mine aren&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I replied. <br>Deputy Olson didn&#x2019;t say anything. He simply sat in the back of the Charger and made angry breathing sounds. <br>We ended up on County Road 30 and followed it toward the Wisconsin border. Near the tiny town of Duxbury it turned from pavement to gravel; a giant plume of yellow and orange dust followed us down the road. This was no-man&#x2019;s-land, thinly populated, little traffic. <br>The radio crackled, its signal not nearly as vibrant as it had been. <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one.&#x201d; <br>I ignored it. <br>&#x201c;Six-twenty-one, do you copy?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you going to answer?&#x201d; Skarda asked. <br>&#x201c;Nope. Let &#x2019;em wonder.&#x201d; <br>The turnoff came up so fast that I was fifty feet past it before I could stop safely. I put the Charger in reverse, backed up, and then turned in.

Simultaneous.</p><p>Grade 6-10-In this poorly developed novel, the narrator, a young woman, wakes up covered with blood and finds a razor-sharp knife on the ground near a dead, beautiful blond teenager. She has no idea who she is and doesn't even recognize her own voice, but somehow retains knowledge of how to drive the car, which opens with the key she finds in her jeans pocket. Further clues are discovered in the purse beneath the driver's seat-a license, some credit cards, and a checkbook. "Jenny" drives to her home, where the nightmare intensifies as her loving mother and brother recognize her but she has no memory of them or of Crystal, her best friend (obviously the dead girl). When she falls into bed with Amir, Crystal's boyfriend, and reads Crystal's diary, Jenny begins to put the puzzle pieces together to discover how Amir physically forced himself on her and commanded her to kill her friend. Confusing metaphysics and stereotypical, one-dimensional characters do nothing to move the contrived plot. Try steering teens to Stephen King, Beverly Hastings, and the many other horror-story writers who can put together a plot and characterization with some creativity.<br><i>Susan R. Farber, Chappaqua Library, NY</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 9^-12. Christopher Pike's latest thriller is a supernatural tale of terror and mysticism. Jennifer Hobbs awakens in a forest with no memory and a dead body next to her. She is shocked to discover that she is suspected of murdering her best friend, Crystal, and encouraging a sexual tryst with Crystal's boyfriend. Hard-core mystery fans who demand more than bloody nightmares and convoluted goings-on may find the tale lacking, but Pike fans will read it anyway. <i>Mary Romano Marks</i></p><h2>Striptease (English and French Edition)</h2><p>Celita is a stripper at the Monico, a nightclub in Cannes, as well as the long-standing mistress of Monsieur Leon, the nightclub&#39;s owner. She enjoyed her struggle to win him away from his wife, Madame Florence, but when a new stripper named Maud becomes a star overnight, Celita at once realises that her hold over Leon is threatened. In this artistically-told story from the master of the genre, nothing can prepare us for its violent and startlingly tragic end.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)This is not another of Inspector Maigret's adventures. Rather, it belongs to the second type of Simenon's fiction: the detailed description (almost cruel in its accuracy) of the world of the very poor, imprisoned in their poverty and existing day by day while trying to escape from their frustrating, dead-end existence. The backdrop is a striptease joint in Cannes called the Monico, and the main focus is on Celita, one of the regular "girls" of the nightly show, who schemes to steal owner Monsieur Leon from his ailing, middle-aged wife. This is not a joyful story, and its ending may leave some readers quite depressed. Still, the translation has captured the heavy, emotionally charged atmosphere, and the book raises interesting questions about human survival in economically and socially adverse conditions.

Interviewing the war&#x2019;s last survivors face-to-face, he knew well the importance of being present if you want to get the real story. But he soon came to realize that to get the <i>whole</i> story, he had to go Over There, too. So he did, and discovered that while most Americans regard that war as dead and gone, to the French, who still live among its ruins and memories, it remains very much alive.</p><p>Years later, with the centennial of the war only magnifying this paradox, Rubin decided to go back Over There to see if he could, at last, resolve it. For months he followed the trail of the American Expeditionary Forces on the Western Front, finding trenches, tunnels, bunkers, century-old graffiti and ubiquitous artifacts. But he also found an abiding fondness for America and Americans, and a colorful corps of local after-hours historians and archeologists who tirelessly explore these sites and preserve the memories they embody while patiently waiting for Americans to return and reclaim their own history and heritage. None of whom seemed to mind that his French needed work.</p><p>Based on his wildly popular <i>New York Times</i> series, <i>Back Over There</i> is a timely journey, in turns reverent and iconoclastic but always fascinating, through a place where the past and present are never really separated.</p></p><p>Richard Rubin is the author of <i>Back Over There</i> from St. Martin's Press. He is also the author of <i>The Last of the Doughboys: The Forgotten Generation and</i> <i>Their Forgotten World War </i>and<i> Confederacy of Silence: A True Tale of the New Old South</i>, as well as scores of pieces for The New York Times, The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and Smithsonian, among others. A fifth-generation New Yorker, he now lives in small-town Maine, which baffles his neighbors.<p>&#x201c;A journey back to the French rural landscape where so many American soldiers fell during World War I...a fine on-the-ground account of some of the iconic battles...An eloquent dive into World War I cemeteries, monuments, mines, and trenches.&#x201d; - <i>Kirkus</i><br><i></i><br>&#x201c;This is a fascinating book that brings to life the Great War&#x2019;s brutal trench warefare its lingering presence in rural France...This remarkable work of journalism reminds us of the hardships of that war and the bravery of those called upon to fight it.&#x201d; - <i>The Missourian</i></p><p>&#x201c;A century after the Great War, the battlefields of France are still littered with the evidence of the barbarous fighting--trenches, the abandoned foundations of destroyed villages, and shell fragments galore. But Richard Rubin doesn&#x2019;t pursue this subject merely to give new meaning to the genre of &#x2018;deep travel.&#x2019; This thoroughly researched and entertaining narrative refreshes our understanding of a tragic war and will be welcomed by anyone who enjoys good writing and history.&#x201d; - Rinker Buck, author of <i>The Oregon Trail: A New American Journey</i>,and <i>Flight of Passage</i></p><p>&#x201c;Richard Rubin is a highly-skilled time-traveler whose passion and diligence make the haunted sites of the First World War yield up their amazing stories. By reminding us how real and how recent that war was he has produced an engrossing, important book.&#x201d; - Ian Frazier, author of <i>Great Plains</i> and <i>Travels in Siberia</i></p><p><i>"Delightful</i> may seem like a strange word for a book about war &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s the word that came repeatedly to mind as I turned the pages of Richard Rubin&#x2019;s narrative of his adventures on the French and Belgian battlefields where Americans fought in the Great War. With vast erudition and effervescent style, Rubin brings to life what the Doughboys endured &#x201c;over there&#x201d; a century ago and what he experienced as he retraced their footsteps." - David Laskin, author of <i>The Family: A Journey into the Heart of the 20th Century</i> and <i>The Long Way Home: An American Journey from Ellis Island to the Great War</i></p><p>"<i>Back Over There is </i>a thoughtful, emotional, engaging journey into the rich and sometimes forgotten history of WWI." - Susan Orlean, author of <i>The Orchid Thief</i></p><p><i>"Back Over There</i> is journalistic magic, somehow travelling back in time 100 years without leaving the present, in order to bring us a graphic portrayal of our tragic participation in World War I, the Great War that cost 116,000 American lives, and the great legacy that lives on even now. Richard Rubin has traveled the battlegrounds and combat villages of France and has given us not only a graphic portrayal of the bloody battles in the trenches, in the villages and in the air where fighter planes dueled and bombs dropped for the first time, but a moving portrayal of the eternally grateful French people who keep the memory alive to this day.&#x201d; - A.E. Hotchner, author of <i>Hemingway in Love</i></p><p>&#x201c;Richard Rubin has written a unique book--a combination of history and travelogue that restores the battlefields of WWI and the men who fought on them to remarkable, often heartbreaking life.&#x201d; - Thomas Fleming, author <i>of The Illusion of Victory, America in World War I</i></p><p>"It was called the Great War, and it brought America--and millions of ordinary Americans--decisively into the wider world for the first time. We would never be the same again. But our entry into the conflict was a century ago--knowledge and memories fade. A keen student of the war, Richard Rubin set out on a journey along what were once the front lines in northern France. With an eye for compelling and sometimes chilling detail--the graffiti scrawled in tunnels, the rusted ordnance turned up by ploughs, the lonely grave of the last American killed--he has produced a personal account of historical discovery that is human and haunting, and written with literary flair. The First World War, we come to realize, is both distant enough to evoke the clashes of antiquity and recent enough to feel like yesterday." - Cullen Murphy, author of <i>Are We Rome?</i></p></p><h2>The Wrong Side of Murder Creek: A White Southerner in the Freedom Movement</h2><p>Even forty years after the civil rights movement, the transition from son and grandson of Klansmen to field secretary of SNCC seems quite a journey. In the early 1960s, when Bob Zellner&#x2019;s professors and classmates at a small church school in Alabama thought he was crazy for even wanting to do research on civil rights, it was nothing short of remarkable. Now, in his long-awaited memoir, Zellner tells how one white Alabamian joined ranks with the black students who were sitting-in, marching, fighting, and sometimes dying to challenge the Southern &#x201c;way of life&#x201d; he had been raised on but rejected. Decades later, he is still protesting on behalf of social change and equal rights. Fortunately, he took the time, with co-author Constance Curry, to write down his memories and reflections. He was in all the campaigns and was close to all the major figures. He was beaten, arrested, and reviled by some but admired and revered by others.<br>The Wrong Side of Murder Creek, winner of the 2009 Lillian Smith Book Award, is Bob Zellner&#x2019;s larger-than-life story, and it was worth waiting for.</p><p>Bob Zellner now lives in Fairhope, Alabama.<br><br>Atlanta-based Constance Curry is a civil rights veteran and has written several books and produced a documentary film.The captivating and profound testimony of a patriot who did everything he could to help make his nation a better place, The Wrong Side of Murder Creek is highly recommended. &#x2015; Midwest Book Review<br><br>Written with Curry (Silver Rights: The Story of the Carter Family's Brace Decision To Send Their Children to an All-White School and Claim Their Civil Rights), this powerful portrait of a courageous man is highly recommended for all but the smallest libraries. &#x2015; Library Journal starred review<br><br>If you want a taste of what life on the front lines was like in the Southern civil rights movement, you have to read this book. &#x2015; Jo Freeman, Senior Women Web<br><br>The journey white Southerners travel in this riveting memoir, from virulent racism to acceptance of blacks&#x2019; civil rights, is as momentous as any in American history. &#x2015; Publishers Weekly<br><br>[Zellner&#x2019;s] words ring with an honesty often lacking in some other accounts of the times, and he recreates the culture of the 1960s with candor and humility.

Richard Leigh followed up his degree from Tufts University, Boston, with postgraduate studies at the University of Chicago and Stony Brook New York State University. They are co-authors of investigative religious books including The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, The Messianic Legacy and The Temple and the Lodge.George Washington, Ben Franklin and Edmund Randolph--all framers of the Constitution--were active Freemasons, as was John Marshall, first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. In this riveting and careful study, Baigent and Leigh (coauthors of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail ) suggest that Freemasonic lodges served America's Founding Fathers as a working model for our federal system. Freemasonry's doctrine of universal brotherhood and tolerance, they assert, had a liberalizing influence in England and France, in particular on Voltaire, Hume, Rousseau, Montesquieu as well as their disciples in what was to become the United States. Early, largely conjectural chapters link Freemasonry to remnants of the Knights Templar, a medieval society of European warrior-monks, some of whose members appear to have found refuge in Scotland. This jigsaw's pieces include Grail romances; the Scots Guard, personal bodyguard to the French king; Scottish freedom-fighter Robert Bruce; Rosicrucians; and the British Royal Society.

Cornish barely survived swallowing a small dose; his cousin Mrs. Katherine Adams died in agony after ingesting the toxic brew. Scandal sheets owned by Hearst and Pulitzer eagerly jumped on this story of fatal high-society intrigue, speculating that the devious killer was a chemist, a woman, or &#x201c;an effeminate man.&#x201d; Forensic studies suggested cyanide as the cause of death; handwriting on the deadly package and the vestige of a label glued to the bottle pointed to a handsome, athletic society scamp, Roland Molineux.<br><br>The wayward son of a revered Civil War general, Molineux had clashed bitterly with Cornish before. He had even furiously denounced Cornish when penning his resignation from the Knickerbocker Club, a letter that later proved a major clue. Bon vivant Molineux had recently wed the sensuous Blanche Chesebrough, an opera singer whose former lover, Henry Barnet, had also recently died . . . after taking medicine sent to him through the mail. Molineux&#x2019;s subsequent indictment for murder led to two explosive trials, a sex-infused scandal that shocked the nation, and a lurid print-media circus that ended in madness and a proud family&#x2019;s disgrace.<br>In bold, brilliant strokes, Schechter captures all the colors of the tumultuous legal case, gathering his own evidence and tackling subjects no one dared address at the time&#x2013;all in hopes of answering the tantalizing question: What powerfully dark motives could drive the wealthy scion of an eminent New York family to foul murder?<br><br>Schechter vividly portrays the case&#x2019;s fascinating cast of characters, including Julian Hawthorne, son of Nathaniel Hawthorne, a prolific yellow journalist who covered the story, and proud General Edward Leslie Molineux, whose son&#x2019;s ignoble deeds besmirched a dignified national hero&#x2019;s final years. All the while Schechter brings alive Manhattan&#x2019;s Gilded Age: a gaslit world of elegant town houses and hidden bordellos, chic restaurants and shabby opium dens, a city peopled by men and women fighting and losing the battle against urges an upright era had ordered suppressed.<br><br>Superbly researched and powerfully written, The Devil&#x2019;s Gentleman is an insightful, gripping work, a true-crime historian&#x2019;s crowning achievement.</p><p>Harold Schechter is a professor of American literature and culture at Queens College, the City University of New York. He is widely celebrated for both fiction and true-crime writing, including The Serial Killer Files. He lives in Brooklyn and Mattituck, Long Island, with his wife, the poet Kimiko Hahn. Visit the author&#x2019;s website at www.haroldschechter.com.1<br><br>On July 15, 1852, Edward Leslie Molineux--still three months shy of his nineteenth birthday--began what he called his "scrapbook." It was not a pasted-in collection of newspaper and magazine clippings (though in later years, when his own name began to appear regularly in the press, he would assemble several of those, too). Rather, this ledger-sized volume was a handwritten miscellany of striking facts, inspirational sayings, and practical information on everything from military tactics to medicinal recipes.<br><br>There is nothing remotely confessional to be found in this journal. His book has all the introspective quality of the official Boy Scout Manual, which it resembles in its single-minded emphasis on self-improvement and the cultivation of the higher civic virtues: industry, tolerance, charity, and a keen sense of duty to one's country. The very look of the pages--inscribed in a flawless hand, perfectly free of blots or corrections, and meticulously labeled with solemn headlines ("The Importance of Physical Exercise," "Useful Rules," "Maxims for the Wise")--speaks vividly of the young writer's capacity for self-discipline, concentrated effort, and high moral seriousness.<br><br>"Be virtuous in mind &amp; body &amp; let your thoughts be pure," he counsels himself in an early entry labeled "Rules for Living." This injunction is followed by a score of precepts designed to promote physical, mental, and moral soundness:<br><br>Use dumbbells twice a day.<br><br>Bathe every morning.<br><br>Always get up when you first awake, no matter what time it is. One hour in the morning is worth two at night!<br><br>Do everything in a cool, active, and energetic manner.<br><br>In times of danger or trouble, first think--then act coolly and decisively.<br><br>Never be idle--always have something to do.<br><br>Never shrink from an unpleasant duty.<br><br>Persevere--never give up a thing until you have tried it every<br><br>possible way. Perseverance is the best school for every manly virtue.<br><br>Never be prejudiced nor allow yourself to be led by others.<br><br>If you are in the wrong, acknowledge it frankly.<br><br>Harden in every possible way your body but not your conscience.<br><br>Give up all bad habits.<br><br>Use no slang language.<br><br>Speak kindly.<br><br>Be truthful.<br><br>Be truly polite.<br><br>In studying, concentrate your thoughts solely upon the subject<br><br>before you.<br><br>Be charitable in thought as well as action.<br><br>Love your God &amp; read his doctrines &amp; fail not to address him night &amp; morning.1<br><br>Elsewhere in the journal, he transcribes the rules laid down by Benjamin Franklin as a prescription for happiness and success: "Eat not to dullness," "Avoid trifling conversation," "Waste nothing," "Let all things have their place," "Use no hurtful deceit," "Tolerate no uncleanness in body, clothes, or habitation," and so on.<br><br>Fascinated by every aspect of warfare, he fills his journal with extensive notes--often accompanied by his own diagrams and hand-drawn maps--on a sweeping array of military matters: the proper construction of field fortifications, the organization of the Hungarian army, the strategic deployment of troops in the battle of Waterloo.<br><br>At the same time, he had a lifelong love of poetry. He read Chaucer and Milton for pleasure and had a boundless admiration for the writings of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.<br><br>He came honestly by his love of reading. His father, William, was a printer; his mother, Maria Leslie, a "remarkably intelligent woman [who] took great delight in reading French and German and was also a close student of English and American literature."2<br><br>Young Edward's enthusiasm for all things military was also a family legacy. His ancestors included soldiers who had taken part in the Norman invasion, fought alongside King Henry V at Agincourt, been slain on the battlefield during the War of the Roses, and received personal commendations for bravery from Henry VIII.<br><br>It was (and is) a proud and ancient line, whose origins can be traced to one Robert de Moulin--the son (according to family legend) of Abelard and Heloise.3 At the time of Edward's birth in October 1833, his father still retained the traditional spelling of his last name--Molyneux. It was only two years later--when William brought his wife and eight surviving children to the United States--that he adopted the somewhat less exotic-looking spelling.<br><br>Though the historical record is hazy, indications are that they settled in Manhattan, where William opened a print shop on the corner of Ann and Nassau streets, and where, two years later, the Molineuxs' youngest child, Arthur--just twenty-two months old--died and was laid to rest in the vault of the Methodist Church on First Street.<br><br>William himself died in 1857 at the age of sixty-eight. By then, he was no longer living with his wife and children. Exactly what caused this estrangement is a mystery, though given the stigma attached to broken marriages in those days, the reasons could not have been trivial. What is known is that by 1851 William was separated from his family and living on Staten Island. Maria and the children, in the meantime, had moved to the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, where Edward Leslie Molineux would reside for the remainder of his long and eventful life.<br><br>At seventeen, Edward was a handsome youth--brown-haired, blue-eyed--whose erect, aristocratic carriage made him seem taller than his five feet three inches. He had been educated at the Mechanics School on Broadway and Park Place. (Despite its name, the Mechanics School was not a vocational institution. Run by the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen, it provided a tuition-free general education to the children of its members at a time before New York City had a municipal public school system. As the son of a printer, Edward was eligible for admission.)<br><br>That year, 1851, seventeen-year-old Edward found a job at the paint-manufacturing firm of Daniel F. Tiemann &amp; Company, whose owner was active in New York City politics and would eventually serve a two-year term as mayor.4 Within this bustling concern, young Edward--with his brains, ambition, and indefatigable energy--thrived. In the manner of a Horatio Alger hero, he quickly rose to a position of responsibility, handling all of the firm's voluminous correspondence and occupying the front office with several other clerks.<br><br>In 1854, even as Edward continued to establish himself in business and (partly through his association with Daniel F. Tiemann) involve himself in city politics, the twenty-year-old Molineux commenced what would be a long and illustrious military career.<br><br>On June 15 of that year, he enlisted in the New York State Militia as a member of the Brooklyn City Guard, a celebrated light-artillery company whose smartly executed drills and dress parades had inspired a popular parlor tune, "The Brooklyn City Guard Quick Step." The few extant records from this period in Edward's life show how quickly he advanced through the noncommissioned ranks--no surprise, given his ferocious drive and exceptional abilities.<br><br>In 1858, when the U.S. government needed a courier for an important diplomatic mission to Venezuela, the Department of State chose Edward, who discharged his duties with his usual professional grace. It was not long after his return in January 1859 that he was introduced to Hattie Davis Clark of East Hartford, Connecticut. Exactly where and under what circumstances they met is unknown, as are all details of their courtship. By the following December, however, they were betrothed. That Christmas, Edward gave her an illustrated volume of Schiller's poetry, inscribed "To Hattie from Ned." For the emotionally reserved, unremittingly proper Molineux, his use of his pet name--employed only by his family and closest friends--was a mark of the intimacy that had developed between them.<br><br>In the meantime, he continued to make himself indispensable to his employers--so much so that in 1860, he was made a partner in the firm. Business was bad for the Tiemanns, however. Most of their customers were Southern merchants, and sales fell off dramatically as tensions rose between the North and South following the election of Abraham Lincoln in November.<br><br>In late December of that year, Edward began a new journal, this one composed of his own philosophical musings. One of the earliest entries is dated January 1861. Titled "The First Day of the New-Year," it is written in Molineux's loftiest style, full of high-minded sentiments about the opportunities afforded by the coming year "to correct past errors, to cultivate new virtues, to accomplish greater things."<br><br>It is not until the end of the essay that the twenty-seven-year-old deals directly with the momentous events of the day and their immediate implications for his own happiness and well-being. Here, the tone becomes deeply affecting as he contemplates two radically different futures, and girds himself to face the worst with his usual courage, honor, and gallantry:<br><br>And for myself, how far in this year of 1861 I may proceed, God alone knows; for who can tell what this eventful year may bring forth!<br><br>If to happiness and peace, all thanks to the Almighty! But if plain visible duty points to the other path--where men's passions rage &amp; where patriotism demands us to defend principles &amp; secure future happiness at the bitter price of present suffering, danger &amp; if needs be life itself--then let me rise superior to all considerations in defense of the right &amp; let me recollect that "His Hand is above me" &amp; let my foot be firm to do His Will.<br><br>It didn't take long for Edward Molineux to learn what the future held. On April 12, 1861--less than four months after he penned his New Year's essay--Confederate forces under General Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard opened fire on Fort Sumter.<br><br>The Civil ...</p><h2>My Hippie Grandmother</h2><p><b>An enthusiastic ode to free spirits of all generations.<br></b><br><br>Who says grandmothers have to wear tidy buns and be relegated to rocking chairs? In lilting rhyme and sunny psychedelic colors, Reeve Lindbergh and Abby Carter introduce the most vibrant, tie-dyed grandmother ever to dance her way across a picture book - together with her cat named Woodstock, her guitar-strumming boyfriend, her organic garden, and her very proud granddaughter.

I didn&#x2019;t know anything about this grandmother, but I couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about her.

She is also the creator of the Fresh Samantha juice character and all her colorful friends. About MY HIPPIE GRANDMOTHER, she says, "My mom was a hippie mother <br>who started an alfalfa sprout business out of our basement, so this story really brought me back to my childhood."PreS-Gr. 2. In this sunny picture book, a little girl talks about her hippie grandmother and what makes her special: "I have a hippie grandmother. / I'm really glad she's mine. She hasn't cut her hair at all / Since nineteen sixty-nine." From the cat named Woodstock to the "Flower Power" poster on the wall, there are plenty of period details, but they would barely rise above the level of cliche without the breezy, natural sounding verse that carries them so lightly and joyfully along. The watercolor-and-gouache illustrations reflect the spirit of the verse. Their harmonious colors, subtle patterns, and wiggly lines suggest music in the background. Don't look for nostalgia here, just a lively, intergenerational love song that features something rarely seen in picture books: a contemporary grandmother.

With or without plants and flowers, they come in every conceivable size and shape-square, oblong, octagonal, or whatever your pleasure. The conservatory adds a treasured space to any home and makes a strong statement of individual style. The conservatories surveyed here play a rich architectural role through the use of classic detailing or sophisticated modern materials. Some are based on graceful Victorian antecedents while others are modernist sculptures of glass and steel. The evocative photographs in the book survey the spectrum of styles and interior design-everything from a Zen-inspired glass perch where the landscape outside becomes the room to a casual lounging area enclosed by a virtual jungle canopy. Specific chapters focus on decorating and accessorizing and demystify difficult decisions (color schemes, floor materials, and controlling natural light). Recent advances in weatherproofing, glass engineering, flooring, lighting, and zoned heating and cooling are covered. Also included is an A-to-Z glossary of recommended plants plus a directory of manufacturers and suppliers.</p><p><b>Jackum Brown</b> is a writer specializing in interior design, home renovation, and landscaping.

Reprint.</p><p>Don Coldsmith teaches at Emporia State University.Coldsmith continues his Spanish Bit Saga, historicals about life among the Plains Indians (Track of the Bear), with an entry that's at once elegiac and down-to-earth. Set in the 18th century, this new story depicts the trials of the tribe known as "the People" as they cope with the dangers posed by European diseases against which they have no natural immunity. The narrative begins just after the end of the annual Sun Dance, which brings together all the bands of the People as well as other tribes. For the aged Running Deer, it will be her last Sun Dance. Recently widowed, she believes that she has nothing left to live for and so vows that she will take her own life rather than become a burden on her friends and relatives. As her band breaks camp and heads for its winter grounds, she and her tribespeople come upon the deserted large village of another tribe. The reasons for the camp's abandonment soon become clear: it has been struck by the dreaded poch (French for smallpox). The only survivor is a young girl who is already exhibiting signs of the plague. Though others in Running Deer's band want to leave the girl to die, Running Dear decides to nurse her back to health. The bond formed between the old woman and Gray Mouse, who also becomes known as Child-of-the-Dead, forms the emotional center of this novel, which turns on love, the meaning of life and the tension between cultural alienation and the need to belong. In time, Gray Mouse grows into a young woman among a people not her own; her longing to return to her own tribe resolves in a finale that's at once touching and promising of a sequel. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Roll the Bones: The History of Gambling</h2><p>A narrative chronicle traces gambling&#39;s early emergence from divination rituals through its modern incarnation as a global and cultural diversion, in an account that documents such topics as the practice of casting lots, the invention of playing cards in twelfth-century China, and the role of organized crime in illegal gambling operations.</p><p>This is the original edition of the book--I&#39;ve now got a new, revised edition with more material on casinos, available in print and on Kindle.

This book tells the story of the thirty-year unfolding and undoing of that movement.<p>Ada Ferrer examines the participation of black and mulatto Cubans in nationalist insurgency from 1868, when a slaveholder began the revolution by freeing his slaves, until the intervention of racially segregated American forces in 1898. In so doing, she uncovers the struggles over the boundaries of citizenship and nationality that their participation brought to the fore, and she shows that even as black participation helped sustain the movement ideologically and militarily, it simultaneously prompted accusations of race war and fed the forces of counterinsurgency.</p><p>Carefully examining the tensions between racism and antiracism contained within Cuban nationalism, Ferrer paints a dynamic portrait of a movement built upon the coexistence of an ideology of racial fraternity and the persistence of presumptions of hierarchy.</p></p><p>"An admirable book; Ada Ferrer has attentively examined the dynamics between the racial groups involved in Cuba's struggle towards independence. . . .

Herbert, author of the acclaimed Impressionism: Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society, presents a new interpretation of Monet's beautiful seascapes of the Normandy coast. Discussing more than fifty works, Herbert shows how these splendid pictures of Etretat and other resorts reflect the dialogue between the modern city and pre-modern nature that underlay tourism. Interweaving the colorful history of sea resorts, stylistic analysis, details of Monet's life, and reflections on the marketing of his art, this book offers a fascinating new perspective on some of the artist's most beloved works.<br>Herbert points out that in early paintings at Sainte-Adresse and Trouville Monet represented vacationers and resort leisure, but when he returned to the Normandy coast in the early 1880s, he painted lonely views that eliminated all signs of tourism. He shows that generations of vacationers seeking these views had transformed fishing villages into resorts, even as they wished to preserve the illusions of a pre-modern seacoast. Monet's modernity lay in the production of neo-romantic myths, illusions of spontaneous responses to untouched nature that were welcomed by Parisian galleries and international collectors. At the same time, Herbert notes, modernity is also found in Monet's evocative brushwork and color and in his dramatic bird's-eye views, which speak to modern culture's search for personal release from the workplace.</p><p>Robert L. Herbert, is a Professor of Art on the Alumnae Foundation at Mount Holyoke College.Herbert (Impressionism, LJ 10/15/88) examines Monet's 1860s to 1880s paintings of Etretat on the Normandy coast, discussing the famous sea views of the Mannesport, Port d'Aval, and other points and comparing them with photographs, sketches, guidebooks, and the works of artists such as Courbet and Boudin. Linking the artist with tourists who may tread on well-traveled paths but see themselves as alone with nature, Herbert presents Monet as a neo-Romantic portraying a much-populated resort as a quaint fishing village. Herbert's analysis is insightful, and the conclusions he draws from well-documented sources are worth studying. Unfortunately, some of the details reproduced in this highly illustrated book are bled to the edge of the page; these plates give the feel of a painted surface but lack compositional structure and seem overpowering and disjointed. Aside from that, the book is beautifully produced and will appeal to specialists, travelers to Etretat, and lay readers who want to know Monet from Herbert's unique perspective.<br><i>Ellen Bates, New York</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The High Priests of War</h2><p>The Secret History of How America&#39;s &#34;Neo-Conservative&#34; Trotskyites came to power and Orchestrated the war against Iraq as the First Step in their drive for Global Empire.

Hefty, intricately plotted, and intellectually ambitious, <i>Fingerpost</i> has drawn the inevitable comparisons to Umberto Eco's <i>The Name of the Rose</i> and, for once, the comparison is apt. <p> The year is 1663, and the setting is Oxford, England, during the height of Restoration political intrigue. When Dr. Robert Grove is found dead in his Oxford room, hands clenched and face frozen in a rictus of pain, all the signs point to poison. Rashomon-like, the narrative circles around Grove's murder as four different characters give their version of events: Marco da Cola, a visiting Italian physician--or so he would like the reader to believe; Jack Prestcott, the son of a traitor who fled the country to avoid execution; Dr. John Wallis, a mathematician and cryptographer with a predilection for conspiracy theories; and Anthony Wood, a mild-mannered Oxford antiquarian whose tale proves to be the book's "instance of the fingerpost." (The quote comes from the philosopher Bacon, who, while asserting that all evidence is ultimately fallible, allows for "one instance of a fingerpost that points in one direction only, and allows of no other possibility.") </p><p> Like <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, this is one whodunit in which the principal mystery is the nature of truth itself. Along the way, Pears displays a keen eye for period details as diverse as the early days of medicine, the convoluted politics of the English Civil War, and the newfangled fashion for wigs. Yet Pears never loses sight of his characters, who manage to be both utterly authentic denizens of the 17th century and utterly authentic human beings. As a mystery, <i>An Instance of the Fingerpost</i> is entertainment of the most intelligent sort; as a novel of ideas, it proves equally satisfying.</p>"It is 1663, and England is wracked with intrigue and civil strife. When an Oxford don is murdered, it seems at first that the incident can have nothing to do with great matters of church and state. Who poured the arsenic into the victim's brandy? The evidence points to Sarah Blundy, a servant girl....She confesses to the crime and is sentenced to be hanged.<p>"Yet, little is as it seems in this gripping novel, which dramatizes the ways in which witnesses can see the same events yet remember them falsely.

Created in 1972, <em>The Arctic Marauder</em> is a downright prescient example of proto-&#x201c;steampunk&#x201d; science fiction &#x2015; or perhaps more accurately, and to coin a spinoff genre, &#x201c;icepunk.&#x201d;<br><br> In 1899, &#x201c;L&#x2019;Anjou,&#x201d; a ship navigating the Arctic Ocean from Murmansk, Russia, to Le Havre, France comes across a stunning sight: A ghostly, abandoned vessel perched high atop an iceberg. But exploring this strange apparition is the last thing the sailors will ever do, as their own ship is soon dispatched to Davy Jones&#x2019; locker via a mysterious explosion.<br><br> Enter J�r�me Plumier, whose search for his missing uncle, the inventor Louis-Ferdinand Chapoutier, brings him into contact with the sinister, frigid forces behind this &#x2015; and soon he too is headed towards the North Pole, where he will content with mad scientists, monsters of the deep, and futuristic submarines and flying machines. Told with brio in hilarious slabs of vintage purple prose, <em>The Arctic Marauder</em> works both as ripping good adventure story and parody of same, and, predating as it does the later and not dissimilar Adele Blanc-Sec series, is a keystone in Tardi&#x2019;s oeuvre in his fantastical mode. 64 pages of black-and-white comics</p><p>Tardi is a pioneering European cartoonist. His Adele Blanc-Sec series was adapted into a feature by Luc Besson, and he was behind the recent animated film&nbsp;April and the&nbsp;Extraordinary World. His comics are award-winning (including the U.S.'s Eisners).&nbsp;He lives in Paris with his wife, the singer Dominique Grange, and their cats.&#x201c;Starred Review. This... phenomenal one-shot [is] a baroque masterpiece... Precisely calibrated, perfectly laid out, and incredibly graphic, this is as good as adventure comics get.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Tardi&#x2019;s story is one thing, but his beautiful renderings give it a depth that brings it far beyond satire. The attention given to the Victoriana �� in technology, fashion and graphic layout �� functions as a love letter to that bygone world, which keeps the book from ever seeming cartoonish. . .&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Seven, <em>North Adams Transcript</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Turns out it wasn&#x2019;t that easy navigating the Arctic Ocean from Russian to France at the turn of the 20th century. If you dig on Poe and Verne and antique diving helmets, this woodcut melodrama is just for you.�&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Paul Montgomery, <em>iFanboy</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The &#x201c;ice-punk&#x201d; story, which nods to Jules Verne and his 19th-century forward-thinking compatriots, starts out more like Brian Selznick&#x2019;s <em>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</em> &#x2015; short on text, long on pretty pictures and old-timey atmosphere &#x2015; but gradually moves toward mental.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Hillary Brown, <em>Paste</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s recommended for those who like submarines disguised as icebergs, world-domination plots, detailed schematics of bizarre inventions, heroic dowagers, and sudden reversals, as well as for those who&#x2019;d like to see all of the above rendered in Tardi&#x2019;s typically detailed linework, which looks amazing even when obscured by ice and snow.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Noel Murray, <em>The A.V. Club</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Rendered in clear-line detail and taking place in the North Pole, the bleak graphic novel follows the frosty exploits of a young man in search of his missing inventor uncle. The ice-punk trend starts here.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Alternative Press</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Really loving Fantagraphics for putting out the Tardi books in English &#x2015; Jacques Tardi is amazing and one of my all time favorites!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Guy Davis (<i>B.P.R.D., The Marquis</i>)</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A wickedly sly take on classic turn-of-the-century pulp adventures that nevertheless manages to both tweak and evoke those stories. It is, in short, a blast to read.... <em>Marauder</em> looks quite unlike any comic you&#x2019;ve read before.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Chris Mautner, <em>Robot 6</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The art is wonderful. Tardi has this rounded style that is unique and easily identifiable, all at once his signature. The level of detail is astounding, in the background and mechanical details as rendered faux woodcuts...: be sure to drink in every inch of this black and white work.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Scott VanderPloeg, <em>Comic Book Daily</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In short, <em>The Arctic Marauder</em> is pure fun, silly and dark camp. It&#x2019;s a beautiful book.. There aren&#x2019;t many books quite like it; comics readers are better off for having Tardi available here in the States.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael C.

She provides a detailed overview of the craft and gives helpful instruction on all elements of writing, from setting and plot to technique and process. To illustrate her points, George presents excerpts from a number of well-known writers, including Barbara Kingsolver, Harper Lee, E. M. Forster, John Irving, Toni Morrison, Stephen King, Ernest Hemingway, and Alice Hoffman. </p><p>In addition to being a clear and concise guide to fiction writing, Write Away also opens a window into the life of Elizabeth George. It reveals the inspiring personal story of how the distinguished author came to be published and how she meticulously researches and crafts her novels.</p><p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>I have a love-hate relationship with the writing life. I wouldn't wish to have any other kind of life . . . and on the other hand, I wish it were easier. And it never is. The reward comes sentence by sentence. The reward comes in the unexpected inspiration. The reward comes from creating a character who lives and breathes and is perfectly real. But such effort it takes to attain the reward! I would never have believed it would take such effort.</em></blockquote><p></p><p>Elizabeth George started her career as a teacher and has spent several years teaching creative writing. She has a solid understanding of the craft and a storyteller's enticing way of passing along helpful information, all of which comes through marvelously in this informative book. </p></p><p><p>Elizabeth George is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of sixteen novels of psychological suspense, one book of nonfiction, and two short story collections. Her work has been honored with the Anthony and Agatha awards, the Grand Prix de Litt�rature Polici�re, and the MIMI, Germany's prestigious prize for suspense fiction. She lives in Washington State.</p>Here's a useful book for the novice writer battling the fears and insecurities that attend when she contemplates her first novel. Highly successful as the writer of a dozen novels of suspense (A Place of Hiding, etc.) and a teacher with significant experience, George reveals that those same fears and insecurities still bedevil her. She quickly moves beyond that to a consideration of the craft of writing-mastering the tools and techniques that a writer needs in order to create art. While George illustrates her points with passages from both her own works and those of numerous writers she admires (Martin Cruz Smith, Barbara Kingsolver, Louise Erdrich, Michael Dorris), this remains more of a how-I-do-it book than a how-to-do-it book. Thus George will typically discuss an aspect of writing, such as creating the landscape of a novel, illustrate it with examples from various writers and then show how she approaches it. The result is an informative, instructive and idiosyncratic examination of the structure of the novel and of one writer's rigorously disciplined approach to creating one. George makes clear that writing is a job and that mastering the tools and techniques of the craft can go a long way toward making a writer successful. Finally, she advocates self-discipline, or what Bryce Courtenay (The Power of One) calls "bum glue." As George puts it, "A lot of writing is simply showing up... day after day, same time and same place." Both aspiring writers and fans of George's novels should enjoy the author's insights into the creative process. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His memoir confirms that, despite the spark of his fiction, Auchincloss himself was the most entertaining character he has created. No traitor to his class but occasionally its critic, he returns us to his Society which was, he maintains, less interesting than its members admitted. You may differ as he unfurls his life with dignity, summoning his family (particularly his father who suffered from depression and forgave him for hating sports) and intimates. Brooke Astor and her circle are here, along with glimpses of Jacqueline Onassis. Most memorable, though, is his way with those outside the salon: the cranky maid; the maiden aunt, perpetually out of place; the less-than-well-born boy who threw himself from a window over a woman <i>and</i> a man. Here is Auchincloss, an American master, being Auchincloss, a rare eye, a generous and lively spirit to the end. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Louis Auchincloss was honored in the year 2000 as a &#x201c;Living Landmark&#x201d; by the New York Landmarks Conservancy. During his long career he wrote more than sixty books, including the story collection <i>Manhattan Monologues</i> and the novel <i>The Rector of Justin</i>. The former president of the Academy of Arts and Letters, he resided in New York City until his death in January 2010. <br></p><p>1<br>Genealogy, et cetera<br>OF MANY PEOPLE it does not tell us much to describe them as residents of New York City because so large a portion of those so situated were born and raised elsewhere or are even recent arrivals. In my own case, the description is only too telling, as all eight of my grandparents lived the bulk of their lives in this marvelous place.<br>&nbsp;I was born in 1917 to parents who had been wed in their early twenties in 1911. My father, Joseph Howland Auchincloss, named for a great uncle who had been a Civil War general, was a member of a prominent New York law firm known by the abbreviated title of Davis Polk. (The senior partner was the former Democratic presidential candidate John W. Davis.) My mother, the former Priscilla Stanton, was a member of a large, close-knit, and socially active clan, the Dixons, who lived in neighboring brownstones on West Forty-ninth Street and summered in shingle villas by the sea in Southampton.<br>&nbsp;Both of my parents lived to be old and were devoted to their four children, John, Priscilla, myself, and Howland. But a seldom-discussed shadow complicated our lives. My father suffered all his life from severe periodic depressions that sometimes caused him to suspend the practice of law for as much as a year. It was as though something in his spirit simply fell away upon occasion and, whatever his exertions, could not be regained. Yet my father remained charming and popular with the world at large, whatever the cost to himself. We were not raised to show our problems or disappointments in public.</p> <p>The term &#x201c;getting ahead&#x201d; invokes a sacred American goal. Yet it was not one ever much emphasized by my father, who was utterly content with his partners, his practice, his family, and his sports. He had no hankering for political office or other distinction. Until the onslaught of his nervous ailments in late middle age, he seemed as happy as a man could be. And why should he not have been? To support his devoted wife and children he could count, in the year 1931 for example, on the following assets: a modest but ample brownstone in Manhattan; a house in Long Island for weekends and summer; a rented villa in Bar Harbor, Maine, for July; four housemaids; two children&#x2019;s nurses; a couple to maintain the Long Island abode; a chauffeur and four cars; several social clubs; and private schools for the children.<br>&nbsp;Mother used to warn us when we went to the country for the weekend: &#x201c;Now don&#x2019;t expect anything fancy; we&#x2019;ve just got the couple!&#x201d; Father would add that &#x201c;the couple&#x201d; referred to most often in such circumstances was actually never more than one and a half people. (One always drank and the other was, unfailingly, a treasure.) But even so!<br>&nbsp;My father managed all of the above on an income of a hundred thousand dollars a year, out of which he managed to make an annual saving. Of course the dollar went further then, but still. Yet it never occurred to me that we were rich. We lived only as other successful lawyers&#x2019; and doctors&#x2019; families did.<br>&nbsp;I was quite aware of who the rich were. They inhabited Beaux Arts mansions rather than brownstones and had butlers and sometimes organs in the front hall. One of Father&#x2019;s uncles had married a Standard Oil heiress. Now she was rich. She had thirty in help.<br>&nbsp;The younger members of my world took the fact that it was supported by armies of domestic servants, like our beloved Maggie, largely for granted. That these domestics were mostly recruited from an Ireland that could no longer support its own we accepted. Without thinking too much about the circumstances. Just as we accepted the brownstone stoops that ascended to our front doors and the lights on stilts that controlled the traffic on Fifth Avenue. I don&#x2019;t recall even discussing with another child the plight of the poor women who lived in narrow cubicles on the often cold top floors of our brownstones and who worked around the clock with one day off a week and nothing to do on it. At Christmas, one heard the parental whispered warning about not giving too much to the maids because &#x201c;they give it all to the church.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;The help weren&#x2019;t the only group often ignored. I didn&#x2019;t meet any Jews until I was sent to Bovee on Fifth Avenue at Sixty-fourth Street, which, unlike the other fashionable boys&#x2019; day schools of the time, had no restrictions. I don&#x2019;t know why Father selected it, but it had a high reputation and most of the boys came from Protestant families. My time there was a great blessing, for getting to know some Jewish boys made me question the casual anti-Semitism that sprinkled the conversation at home and in the houses of family friends and relations.<br>&nbsp;I don&#x2019;t recall people (grownups, of course) giving any particular reason for objecting to Jews, except that they were supposed to be grasping in money matters. It simply seemed to be accepted that they were to be avoided at all costs in terms of social mixing. It was as if they carried some easily contractible and unattractive, though not necessarily dangerous, ailment.<br>&nbsp;Although I neither understood nor sympathized with the prejudice&#x2014;I liked my Bovee Jewish friends and admired their wealth&#x2014;I saw that the attitude, however displeasing, was a natural phenomenon of the parents&#x2019; generation. When we moved our summer residence from Long Island&#x2019;s south to north shore, I gave my friends Father&#x2019;s reason as placidly as if it were a change of weather: &#x201c;Because of the Jews.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Mother was too intelligent for prejudice but too indifferent to fight it. A friend of my father&#x2019;s attending a reception at the Stantons as a young man told me that he once found my mother, Priscilla, then eighteen, pouting in a corner at some sort of gathering. She complained: &#x201c;Mother asks all her pet Jews, but won&#x2019;t have mine.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;Mother&#x2019;s prejudices were non-denominational. What she complained about in me was my admiration of wealth. &#x201c;My grandmother&#x2019;s snobbishness has come back to earth in Louis,&#x201d; she used to say.<br>&nbsp;Her grandmother, born Babcock, had been a rigid, bewigged old dowager with the rough candor about money of an earlier New York society. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say you don&#x2019;t like Mrs. Kingsland,&#x201d; she once reproached my mother. &#x201c;She has three million dollars.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;The elderly lady was not much impressed by Mother&#x2019;s engagement to an Auchincloss. &#x201c;I suppose it&#x2019;s better than being the last leaf on the tree&#x201d; was her comment. She thought of Mother at twenty-one as an old maid! She herself had been married at sixteen.</p> <p>Despite the fact that there were few with whom she could discuss his depression, Mother gave my father unfailing and needed support. She had no ambition for the glories of the world, but she possessed a strong desire to hang on to the benefits of her family&#x2019;s share of the status quo for her children. She had great faith in the economic opportunities available to her sons if they followed the normal course of their class and fortune. She dreaded their striking out into untested areas.<br>&nbsp;In all of this she was an average mother; the trouble was that she was not an average woman. She was brilliantly imaginative, well read, and independently daring; she should have been the writer in the family. As it was she gave too much of her fine mind to the care of her offspring at the expense of their independence.<br>&nbsp;But where these children were concerned she was abjectly timid; she deemed it her sacred duty to spare them all risks, emotional and physical. Her fine mind was singularly free of prejudice, but she saw danger to her dependents in the unconventional. And she saw it in any overemphasis on the arts, which she could not justify except in the case of near genius, which she certainly did not recognize in my literary aspirations, with the result that she used all her formidable talents to discourage my writing. She quite sincerely believed she was sparing me the bitterness of failure. But there was in her also a curious pessimism about the ability of her children to achieve success in any field. If one of us fell in love, for example, she tended to assume it would be unrequited.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Reunion: A Pip and Flinx novel (Adventures of Pip &amp; Flinx)</h2><p><b>Bestselling author Alan Dean Foster returns to his acclaimed Humanx universe, where a young human orphan called Flinx seeks to unlock the dangerous secrets of his past&#x2013;and the uncertain prospects of his future with the aid of the formidable minidrag known as Pip.

However, those new to the series will wonder why they would want to read about a hero who seems, at best, morally questionable based on his first actions in <i>Reunion</i>. A bigger problem still is that the entire book seems to be just a teaser for the ninth novel, and if it takes another five years to arrive, that's a long tease. <i>--Kathie Huddleston</i></p>&gt;<i>At last, </i>New York Times<i> bestselling author Alan Dean Foster returns to his acclaimed Humanx universe, where a young human orphan called Flinx seeks to unlock the dangerous secrets of his past&#x2013;and the uncertain prospects of his future with the aid of the formidable minidrag known as Pip.

A metaphor for the classical music business, the building has fallen from glory, its elaborate stone carving chipped, windows patched with cardboard, and its elegant d�cor plastered over by a greedy landlord and her predatory handyman. Outsiders have never looked farther than the ornate facade...until now. <p>Inside, music transforms a schoolteacher into a beautiful diva, and sustains a renowned pianist who endures two heart transplants to perform with the stars who pay him a pittance. An American goddess of the arts struggles to fulfill a dream, her ominous future mirrored by an older musician whose fantasies drain away in her lonely apartment upstairs. A stunning cellist becomes an AIDS-infected crack addict and prostitute; a Metropolitan Opera violinist is jailed for selling cocaine; and an African-American virtuoso becomes so lost inside the elitist white arts world that he smashes his $185,000 eighteenth-century French violin into splinters. </p><p>The drama of "Mozart in the Jungle" opens during America's Cold War-era optimism, and follows four musicians as their world dissolves into a culture of entitlement for a new generation of classical musicians, who are deaf to changing American tastes and demand. By weaving memoir with investigative arts journalism, Tindall shatters rhetoric about the arts in the United States -- in an real-life tale from a musician whose career paralleled America&#x2019;s late twentieth-century culture boom. As "Mozart in the Jungle" races to its dramatic conclusion, Tindall reveals music as a simple, spiritual gift accessible to all.</p>Journalist and oboist Blair Tindall writes about classical music for the New York Times and has performed, toured and recorded with the New York Philharmonic and many other musical groups. She has taught journalism at Stanford University and oboe at the University of California-Berkeley. <p>"Mozart in the Jungle" was completed during a residency in 2004 at The MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, NH.</p></p><h2>Owl at Home - An I Can Read Book</h2><p>Whether Owl is inviting Winter in on a snowy night or welcoming a new friend he meets while on a stroll, Owl always has room for visitors!</p><p></p><h2>A Ketch Called Tahiti: John G.

To a marriage that ends after a year, leaving Sarah&nbsp;&nbsp;shattered. A trip to Europe with her parents does little to&nbsp;&nbsp;raise her spirits, until she meets William, Duke of Whitfield.&nbsp;&nbsp;In time, despite her qualms, William insists on giving up his distant right to the British&nbsp;&nbsp;throne to make Sarah his dutchess and his wife. <br><br>On their honeymoon, the newlyweds buy an old French chateau, but not long after,&nbsp;&nbsp;the war begins. William joins the allied forces, leaving Sarah,&nbsp;&nbsp;their first child, an infant, and their second child on the way,&nbsp;&nbsp;in France. After the Nazi forces take over the chateau, Sarah&nbsp;&nbsp;continues to survive the terror and deprivation of the Occupation,&nbsp;&nbsp;unwavering in her belief that her missing-in-action husband is still&nbsp;&nbsp;alive.<br><br>After the war, as a gesture of goodwill, the Whitfields start buying&nbsp;&nbsp;jewels offered for sale by impoverished war survivors. With Sarah's style and&nbsp;&nbsp;keen eye, the collection becomes the prestigious Whitfield's&nbsp;&nbsp;jewelry store in Paris. Eventually, their jewelry business expands&nbsp;&nbsp;to London and Rome, as their family grows. Phillip, their firstborn,&nbsp;&nbsp;is stubborn and proud; Julian, their second son, is charming and&nbsp;&nbsp;generous and warm; Isabelle is rebellious and willful; and Xavier,&nbsp;&nbsp;unusual and untamed, is the final unexpected gift of their love. They&nbsp;&nbsp;each find their own way, but will be drawn to the great house of gems their&nbsp;&nbsp;parents built. In <i>Jewels</i>, Danielle Steel takes the reader through&nbsp;&nbsp;five eventful decades that include war, passion, international intrigue,&nbsp;&nbsp;and the strength of family through it all.</p><p>Birthdays are a time for reflection, especially for Sarah, Duchess of Whitfield, who is awaiting the arrival of her far-flung family. Years earlier, reeling from her pending divorce, Sarah Thompson is force-marched through Europe on the grand tour by her concerned parents. Disinterested in the sons, grandsons, and nephews paraded before her by well-meaning acquaintances, Sarah chances upon William Whitfield, the Duke of Whitfield, 14th in line for succession to the English throne. Disarmed by his wit and intrigued by his intellect, Sarah allows William to become her companion in London, warning him they can only be friends. Undeterred, William dismisses Sarah's protestations that her divorce makes her unsuitable to be his duchess and finally convinces Sarah to marry him. While honeymooning in France, Sarah and William happen upon Chateau de la Meuze. Enchanted, the Whitfields buy and set about restoring the estate. But World War II looms, threatening their idyllic existence. Following the birth of their first child, Phillip, William joins the RAF when England declares war on Germany. Reluctantly, he leaves Sarah and Phillip at the chateau. German troops, led by the courtly commandant Joachim von Mannheim, take possession of the chateau to establish a hospital, removing Sarah and Phillip to the caretaker's cottage.<p> When the war ends, William, after being imprisoned for three years and barely surviving the torture that deprived him of the use of his legs, returns to his family. The Whitfields pick up threads of lives strained, but not broken, by war. Soon, they are approached by others who lost everything during the war except a few secreted heirlooms. But jewelry can't put food on the table, and the Whitfields begin purchasing jewelry to provide neighbors with much-needed cash. When William jokingly suggests opening a Paris store, a legacy is born: Whitfield's, Jewelers to the Crown. Over the next decades, which bring three more children, two more branches of Whitfields, and the death of her husband, Sarah is molded into a force to be reckoned with, capable of handling her willful children and a highly successful international business with equal aplomb. Steel paints a portrait of a family, imperfect as they may be, and the powerful matriarch who reminds them of the bond that transcends titles, money, and borders. <i>--Alison Trinkle</i></p>A journey through five eventful decades, Jewels, Danielle Steele&#39;s twenty-ninth work of fiction, is the story of a family whose lives are woven into the fabric of history. On the eve of Sarah Whitfield&#39;s 75th birthday, she stands at the window of her chateau in France, waiting for her family to join her. Her memories take her back to the 1930s in New York, to her early marriage and subsequent shameful divorce. She is persuaded by her parents to join them on a trip abroad in the growing turmoil of pre-war Europe. There she meets William, Duke of Whitfield. Older than Sarah, and fourteenth in line to the British throne, he sparks her intellectual curiosity and makes her laugh. They make their home in a beautiful crumbling French chateau until they are parted by the war. Afterwards they are able to return to the chateau and establish the jewel collection which leads to the House of Whitfield, jewellers to the crowned heads of all Europe. Together they produce a family of four, each of whom is drawn into the family business. Jewels is the story of a great house of gems, a rare family, and an extraordinary marriage. Once again, Danielle Steel explores the lives of people facing challenges we recognise as our own, against the backdrop of war, passion and international intrigue.</p><h2>In Midlife: A Jungian Perspective (Seminar Series 15)</h2><p>Midlife: crisis, anger, dissolution, adventure, change ...

And Persico also provides a definitive answer to the perennial question Did FDR know in advance about the attack on Pearl Harbor?<br><br>By temperament and character, no American president was better suited for secret warfare than FDR. He manipulated, compartmentalized, dissembled, and misled, demonstrating a spymaster's talent for intrigue. He once remarked, "I never let my right hand know what my left hand does." Not only did Roosevelt create America's first central intelligence agency, the OSS, under "Wild Bill" Donovan, but he ran spy rings directly from the Oval Office, enlisting well-placed socialite friends. <br><br>FDR was also spied <i>against</i>. <b>Roosevelt's Secret War </b>presents evidence that the Soviet Union had a source inside the Roosevelt White House; that British agents fed FDR total fabrications to draw the United States into war; and that Roosevelt, by yielding to Churchill's demand that British scientists be allowed to work on the Manhattan Project, enabled the secrets of the bomb to be stolen. And these are only a few of the scores of revelations in this constantly surprising story of Roosevelt's hidden role in World War II.</p><p>Joseph E. Persico presents FDR as one of America's great spymasters. "Few leaders were better adapted temperamentally to espionage than Franklin Roosevelt," writes Persico, author of <i>Nuremberg</i> and Colin Powell's autobiographical collaborator. "FDR compartmentalized information, misled associates, manipulated people, conducted intrigues, used private lines of communication, scattered responsibility, duplicated assignments, provoked rivalries, held the cards while showing few, and left few fingerprints." He was a kind of principled Machiavellian who hoped to achieve several clear ends, such as getting the United States into the Second World War, even though most of the public wanted nothing to do with it (before Pearl Harbor). FDR then pursued these goals with the fervor of an opportunist: "the devious route to a desirable goal; inconstant behavior directed toward constant ends; the warship hiding behind a smoke screen but steered by a moral compass." <p> A good example of this is his relationship with the celebrated aviator Charles Lindbergh. Roosevelt asked J. Edgar Hoover to keep tabs on Lindbergh because he was a critic of the administration, and FDR suspected he was a closeted Nazi (not true, but perhaps an understandable opinion). <i>Roosevelt's Secret War</i> reveals how FDR created a huge intelligence operation and then ran it--he "built espionage into the structure of American government," says Persico. There were plenty of successes (Roosevelt knew about Hitler's plans to invade Russia before they did it), but also failings: Soviet agents burrowed into FDR's administration at the highest levels. One of the best sections of the book addresses a perennial question: Did FDR know the Japanese were about to bomb Pearl Harbor and let them do it because he believed the sneak attack would propel the public into supporting war against the Axis powers? Persico argues that FDR didn't know: "The clues seem to lead to that conclusion like lights on a well-marked runway." He makes a convincing case that "Pearl Harbor was a catastrophe, not a conspiracy." <i>Roosevelt's Secret War</i> is a unique contribution to our understanding of FDR--no other book treats America's longest-serving president as a spymaster--and it will appeal to readers interested in the Second World War and the cloak-and-dagger world of espionage. --<i>John Miller</i></p>Joseph E. Persico&#x2019;s books include <b>Nuremberg: Infamy on Trial</b>, which was made into a major television docudrama, and <b>Piercing the Reich</b>, on the penetration of Nazi Germany by American agents.

Very Good conditions. May have soft reading marks and name of the previous owner.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2010</strong> As the finale to Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, <i>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest </i>is not content to merely match the adrenaline-charged pace that made international bestsellers out of <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em> and <em>The Girl Who Played with Fire</em>. Instead, it roars with an explosive storyline that blows the doors off the series and announces that the very best has been saved for last. A familiar evil lies in wait for Lisbeth Salander, but this time, she must do more than confront the miscreants of her past; she must destroy them. Much to her chagrin, survival requires her to place a great deal of faith in journalist Mikael Blomkvist and trust his judgment when the stakes are highest. To reveal more of the plot would be criminal, as Larsson's mastery of the unexpected is why millions have fallen hard for his work. But rest assured that the odds are again stacked, the challenges personal, and the action fraught with neck-snapping revelations in this snarling conclusion to a thrilling triad. This closing chapter to The Girl's pursuit of justice is guaranteed to leave readers both satisfied and saddened once the final page has been turned. <em>--Dave Callanan</em>Stieg Larsson,<b> </b>who lived in Sweden, was the editor in chief of the magazine <i>Expo</i> and a leading expert on antidemocratic, right-wing extremist and Nazi organizations.

Hollander suggests how to incorporate succession planning for a vacation home into an estate plan and gives practical advice on such things as which entity is best for succession planning, how to develop a cottage schedule, what to do about an owner who fails to pay his or her assessment, whether to establish an "endowment," and how to allocate control between and within generations of owners.</p><br><p>Although Hollander uses the term "cottage," the principles of his book apply to any property that a family wants to retain, whether it is an Adirondack camp, an Upper Midwest cabin, a Western ranch, or an ocean, lake, or riverfront home. Written for the vacation home owner but with information that also will be useful to attorneys and financial planners, the book engages the reader with stories of cottage "wars" and planning gone awry. Narrative examples and easy-to-follow graphics illustrate the more technical aspects of succession planning for a vacation home. The book makes a complex problem understandable and offers methods to help keep a second home in the family for generations.</p></p><p>The first attorney authored book written for the vacation home owner describes the problems inherent to shared cottage ownership and the concerns of parents who wish to pass it on.<b>Rose Hollander</b> has spent more than 19 years working and living in the heart of Michigan cottage country.

Rumor ran rampant: A wild-eyed foreign anarchist with an unpronounceable name had killed the Commander-in-Chief. Eric Rauchway's brilliant Murdering McKinley re-creates Leon Czolgosz's hastily conducted trial and then traverses America as Dr. Vernon Briggs, a Boston alienist, sets out to discover why Czolgosz rose up to kill his President. While uncovering the answer that eluded Briggs and setting the historical record straight about Czolgosz, Rauchway also provides the finest portrait yet of Theodore Roosevelt at the moment of his sudden ascension to the White House.<br><br>For Czolgosz was neither a foreigner nor much of an anarchist. Born in Detroit, he was an American-made assassin of such inchoate political beliefs that Emma Goldman dismissed him as a police informant.

Rumor ran rampant: A wild-eyed foreign anarchist with an unpronounceable name had killed the Commander-in-Chief. Eric Rauchway's brilliant Murdering McKinley re-creates Leon Czolgosz's hastily conducted trial and then traverses America as Dr. Vernon Briggs, a Boston alienist, sets out to discover why Czolgosz rose up to kill his President. While uncovering the answer that eluded Briggs and setting the historical record straight about Czolgosz, Rauchway also provides the finest portrait yet of Theodore Roosevelt at the moment of his sudden ascension to the White House.<br><br>For Czolgosz was neither a foreigner nor much of an anarchist. Born in Detroit, he was an American-made assassin of such inchoate political beliefs that Emma Goldman dismissed him as a police informant.

Christian Ford is a man who is betrayed in an adulterous affair, only to discover that he himself betrayed a woman he loved and abandoned. Throughout the story, Christian attempts to understand the dangerously paradoxical nature of human relations and to show that adultery extends beyond mere physical infidelity.</p><p>Christian Ford is an artist who teaches at a New England prep school; Farol Colorado is a beautiful young woman who works at an art gallery in town. When the two begin their affair, he has an "understanding" with another woman, and Farol is married to her second husband. Theroux's third novel, after Three Wogs and Darconville's Cat, describes the rising and falling phases of their relationship in great psychological detail, focusing on Farol's, and also Ford's, inconstancy. Told from Ford's point of viewin a remote and superior tonethe story remains true to its narrator's shifting passions. Guilt, passion and will are topics for Theroux's intelligent, unstinting analysis, raising suggestions of earlier chroniclers of love in the works of Nabokov and Flaubert. But the questions of whether Farol will leave her husband, of how truthful she is about the rest of her life (and how reliable an observer Ford is) are slight fare for so extensive an examination. In the end, the obsessive narration and dearth of dialogue make for a reading experience as dry and remote as Ford's experience of love. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Christian Ford, a moderately successful painter wasting away in New Hampshire, begins dating a sad young woman named Farol Colorado. She tells him that she is about to divorce her husband, is in group therapy, and is slowly dying of multiple sclerosis. Ford falls hopelessly in love, but as his obsession grows, so too does his annoyance with Farol's superficiality, hypochondria, vindictiveness, and inability to break with her husband. Manic devotion to an undeserving woman is a favorite theme in works of writers from Benjamin Constant to Nabokov. Theroux, best known for the logorrheic extravaganza Darconville's Cat ( LJ 6/1/81), gives us a disturbing, misogynistic novel that invites comparison with such classics. For all fiction collections.

Well-observed accounts of growing up poor and black in 1950s rural Mississippi and of Ware's eventful, combat-heavy first tour in Vietnam are matched by a stirring recounting of the three weeks Ware and another army helicopter pilot spent evading the enemy in the jungles after being shot down. Chronological chapters alternate with short, first-person interludes sketching those hellish weeks Ware spent avoiding the enemy and nearly starving to death. Adding to the drama: Ware discovered that his fellow pilot--who suffered a severe leg wound in the helicopter crash--was a card-carrying member of the Ku Klux Klan. Less revealing and less interesting are Ware's by-the-numbers chapters on his army training, including flight school, further hindered by poorly reconstructed dialogue. Also in the minus category is Ware's political analysis; if the United States hadn't intervened in Vietnam "the imperial communist powers" would "have continued to grab countries." But anyone with a taste for life behind the lines will want this book. <i>(Mar. 7)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He lives in North Carolina.<b>Chapter One</b><p></p><p>The interrogation began like any other.</p><p>Kathryn Dance entered the interview room and found the forty-three-year-old man sitting at a metal table, shackled, looking up at her closely. Subjects always did this, of course, though never with such astonishing eyes. Their color was a blue unlike sky or ocean or famous gems.</p><p>"Good morning," she said, sitting down across from him.</p><p>"And to you," replied Daniel Pell, the man who eight years ago had knifed to death four members of a family for reasons he'd never shared. His voice was soft.</p><p>A slight smile on his bearded face, the small, sinewy man sat back, relaxed. His head, covered with long, gray-black hair, was cocked to the side. While most jailhouse interrogations were accompanied by a jingling soundtrack of handcuff chains as subjects tried to prove their innocence with broad, predictable gestures, Daniel Pell sat perfectly still.</p><p>To Dance, a specialist in interrogation and kinesics -- body language -- Pell's demeanor and posture suggested caution, but also confidence and, curiously, amusement. He wore an orange jumpsuit, stenciled with "Capitola Correctional Facility" on the chest and "Inmate" unnecessarily decorating the back.</p><p>At the moment, though, Pell and Dance were not in Capitola but, rather, a secure interview room at the county courthouse in Salinas, forty miles away.</p><p>Pell continued his examination. First, he took in Dance's own eyes -- a green complementary to his blue and framed by square, black-rimmed glasses. He then regarded her French-braided, dark blond hair, the black jacket and beneath it the thick, unrevealing white blouse. He noted too the empty holster on her hip. He was meticulous and in no hurry. (Interviewers and interviewees share mutual curiosity. She told the students in her interrogation seminars, "They're studying you as hard as you're studying them -- usually even harder, since they have more to lose.")</p><p>Dance fished in her blue Coach purse for her ID card, not reacting as she saw a tiny toy bat, from last year's Halloween, that either twelve-year-old Wes, his younger sister, Maggie, or possibly both conspirators had slipped into the bag that morning as a practical joke. She thought: How's this for a contrasting life? An hour ago she was having breakfast with her children in the kitchen of their homey Victorian house in idyllic Pacific Grove, two exuberant dogs at their feet begging for bacon, and now here she sat, across a very different table from a convicted murderer.</p><p>She found the ID and displayed it. He stared for a long moment, easing forward. "Dance. Interesting name. Wonder where it comes from. And the California Bureau...what is that?"</p><p>"Bureau of Investigation. Like an FBI for the state. Now, Mr. Pell, you understand that this conversation is being recorded?"</p><p>He glanced at the mirror, behind which a video camera was humming away. "You folks think we really believe that's there so we can fix up our hair?"</p><p>Mirrors weren't placed in interrogation rooms to hide cameras and witnesses -- there are far better high-tech ways to do so -- but because people are less inclined to lie when they can see themselves.</p><p>Dance gave a faint smile. "And you understand that you can withdraw from this interview anytime you want and that you have a right to an attorney?"</p><p>"I know more criminal procedure than the entire graduating class of Hastings Law rolled up together. Which is a pretty funny image, when you think about it."</p><p>More articulate than Dance expected. More clever too.</p><p>The previous week, Daniel Raymond Pell, serving a life sentence for the 1999 murders of William Croyton, his wife and two of their children, had approached a fellow prisoner due to be released from Capitola and tried to bribe him to run an errand after he was free. Pell told him about some evidence he'd disposed of in a Salinas well years ago and explained that he was worried the items would implicate him in the unsolved murder of a wealthy farm owner. He'd read recently that Salinas was revamping its water system. This had jogged his memory and he'd grown concerned that the evidence would be discovered. He wanted the prisoner to find and dispose of it.</p><p>Pell picked the wrong man to enlist, though. The short-timer spilled to the warden, who called the Monterey County Sheriff's Office. Investigators wondered if Pell was talking about the unsolved murder of farm owner Robert Herron, beaten to death a decade ago. The murder weapon, probably a claw hammer, was never found. The Sheriff's Office sent a team to search all the wells in that part of town. Sure enough, they found a tattered T-shirt, a claw hammer and an empty wallet with the initials <i>R.H.</i> stamped on it. Two fingerprints on the hammer were Daniel Pell's.</p><p>The Monterey County prosecutor decided to present the case to the grand jury in Salinas, and asked CBI Agent Kathryn Dance to interview him, in hopes of a confession.</p><p>Dance now began the interrogation, asking, "How long did you live in the Monterey area?"</p><p>He seemed surprised that she didn't immediately begin to browbeat. "A few years."</p><p>"Where?"</p><p>"Seaside." A town of about thirty thousand, north of Monterey on Highway 1, populated mostly by young working families and retirees. "You got more for your hard-earned money there," he explained. "More than in your fancy Carmel." His eyes alighted on her face.</p><p>His grammar and syntax were good, she noted, ignoring his fishing expedition for information about her residence.</p><p>Dance continued to ask about his life in Seaside and in prison, observing him the whole while: how he behaved when she asked the questions and how he behaved when he answered. She wasn't doing this to get information -- she'd done her homework and knew the answers to everything she asked -- but was instead establishing his behavioral baseline.</p><p>In spotting lies, interrogators consider three factors: nonverbal behavior (body language, or kinesics), verbal quality (pitch of voice or pauses before answering) and verbal content (what the suspect says). The first two are far more reliable indications of deception, since it's much easier to control what we say than <i>how</i> we say it and our body's natural reaction when we do.</p><p>The baseline is a catalog of those behaviors exhibited when the subject is telling the truth. This is the standard the interrogator will compare later with the subject's behavior when he might have a reason to lie. Any differences between the two suggest deception.</p><p>Finally Dance had a good profile of the truthful Daniel Pell and moved to the crux of her mission in this modern, sterile courthouse on a foggy morning in June. "I'd like to ask you a few questions about Robert Herron."</p><p>Eyes sweeping her, now refining their examination: the abalone shell necklace, which her mother had made, at her throat. Then Dance's short, pink-polished nails. The gray pearl ring on the wedding-band finger got two glances.</p><p>"How did you meet Herron?"</p><p>"You're assuming I did. But, no, never met him in my life. I swear."</p><p>The last sentence was a deception flag, though his body language wasn't giving off signals that suggested he was lying.</p><p>"But you told the prisoner in Capitola that you wanted him to go to the well and find the hammer and wallet."</p><p>"No, that's what <i>he</i> told the warden." Pell offered another amused smile. "Why don't you talk to him about it? You've got sharp eyes, Officer Dance. I've seen them looking me over, deciding if I'm being straight with you. I'll bet you could tell in a flash that that boy was lying."</p><p>She gave no reaction, but reflected that it was very rare for a suspect to realize he was being analyzed kinesically.</p><p>"But then how did he know about the evidence in the well?"</p><p>"Oh, I've got that figured out. Somebody stole a hammer of mine, killed Herron with it and planted it to blame me. They wore gloves. Those rubber ones everybody wears on <i>CSI."</i></p><p>Still relaxed. The body language wasn't any different from his baseline. He was showing only emblems -- common gestures that tended to substitute for words, like shrugs and finger pointing. There were no adaptors, which signal tension, or affect displays -- signs that he was experiencing emotion.</p><p>"But if he wanted to do that," Dance pointed out, "wouldn't the killer just call the police <i>then</i> and tell them where the hammer was? Why wait more than ten years?"</p><p>"Being smart, I'd guess. Better to bide his time. Then spring the trap."</p><p>"But why would the real killer call the prisoner in Capitola? Why not just call the police directly?"</p><p>A hesitation. Then a laugh. His blue eyes shone with excitement, which seemed genuine. "Because <i>they're</i> involved too. The police. Sure...The cops realize the Herron case hasn't been solved and they want to blame somebody. Why not <i>me?</i> They've already got me in jail. I'll bet the cops planted the hammer themselves."</p><p>"Let's work with this a little. There're two different things you're saying. First, somebody stole your hammer <i>before</i> Herron was killed, murdered him with it and now, all this time later, dimes you out. But your second version is that the police got your hammer <i>after</i> Herron was killed by someone else altogether and planted it in the well to blame you. Those're contradictory. It's either one or the other. Which do you think?"</p><p>"Hm." Pell thought for a few seconds. "Okay, I'll go with number two. The police. It's a setup. I'm sure that's what happened."</p><p>She looked him in the eyes, green on blue. Nodding agreeably. </p><p>"Let's consider that. First, where would the police have gotten the hammer?"</p><p>He thought. "When they arrested me for that Carmel thing."</p><p>"The Croyton murders in ninety-nine?"</p><p>"Right. All the evidence they took from my house in Seaside."</p><p>Dance's brows furrowed. "I doubt that. Evidence is accounted for too closely. No, I'd go for a more credible scenario: that the hammer was stolen recently. Where else could somebody find a hammer of yours? Do you have any property in the state?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Any relatives or friends who could've had some tools of yours?"</p><p>"Not really."</p><p>Which wasn't an answer to a y...</p></p><h2>The Golden Ocean</h2><p><p><strong>The first novel Patrick O'Brian ever wrote about the sea, a precursor to the acclaimed Aubrey/Maturin series.</strong></p> In the year 1740, Commodore (later Admiral) George Anson embarked on a voyage that would become one of the most famous exploits in British naval history. Sailing through poorly charted waters, Anson and his men encountered disaster, disease, and astonishing success.

Peter Palofox, second son of a poor Irish parson, sets out on the voyage of a lifetime when he seeks his fortune as a midshipman in Commodore Anson's flotilla. With five ships under his command, Anson leaves England in 1740 to circumnavigate the globe and attack Spanish ships wherever they can be found. Peter comes of age in the complex but sharply defined community of the fleet as they engage in battle, fight disease, and face shipwreck.Patrick O&#39;Brian&#39;s acclaimed Aubrey/Maturin series of historical novels has been described as &#34;a masterpiece&#34; (David Mamet, New York Times), &#34;addictively readable&#34; (Patrick T. Reardon, Chicago Tribune), and &#34;the best historical novels ever written&#34; (Richard Snow, New York Times Book Review), which &#34;should have been on those lists of the greatest novels of the 20th century&#34; (George Will).Set in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, O&#39;Brian&#39;s twenty-volume series centers on the enduring friendship between naval officer Jack Aubrey and physician (and spy) Stephen Maturin. The Far Side of the World, the tenth book in the series, was adapted into a 2003 film directed by Peter Weir and starring Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany. The film was nominated for ten Oscars, including Best Picture.

Also included are dozens of black-and-white line drawings, sketches, and facsimile reproductions of Kerouac's notations from his unpublished notebooks. In writing, Kerouac's restless and relentless experimentation&#x2014;what he called "spontaneous bop prosody"&#x2014;pushed language to the boundaries of meaning. In painting and drawing he found a complementary means of expression. A friend and admirer of painters Willem de Kooning, Larry Rivers, Franz Kline, and Dody Muller, Kerouac was an ardent and deliberate student who worked to develop and refine his skills and his conception of the act of painting&#x2014;a conception related to the spontaneous composition he had pioneered in his books. Ed Adler's essay offers an unprecedented view of Kerouac, the visual artist. Rich in anecdote and drawing on extensive quotation from Kerouac's letters, notebooks, and published writings, Adler's essay demonstrates the biographical and thematic preoccupations common to Kerouac's writing and painting, especially Kerouac's struggle to integrate the two spiritual traditions, Catholicism and Buddhism, to which he was devoted. No consideration of Kerouac will be complete without reference to this heretofor- unseen aspect of his life and work.</p><p>By starting right in with reproductions of the paintings and sketches that Kerouac began making in the late 1950s, a few years after the publication of <i>On the Road</i>, this book comes closer to his animus than the reams of posthumous text produced on him and the Beats generally. Heavily influenced by de Kooning and other New York School painters, the works themselves, long stored with family in Massachusetts and recently unearthed, are bright and spirited, if not transcendent. But viewed as a kind of record of Kerouac's continued, in-the-moment search for an ultimate form of expression, these depictions&#x2014;of friends, popes, angels, street people, coffee cups, the Buddha&#x2014;are quite moving. In this Kerouac estate&#x2013;authorized production, New York University painter and scholar Adler presents 50 paintings in color and 50 sketchbook pages in b&amp;w, thoughtfully laid out and captioned. Historian Douglas Brinkley offers an introduction, and Adler's 17 chapters of text, which make up the book's second half, detail Kerouac's method of and thoughts about artmaking; the interviews and research Adler has conducted pay off in descriptive thickness. The result is a book unique within the Kerouac industry, a real achievement indeed. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

McHugh was found in an alcoholic blackout in his wrecked car after visiting a patient of his, the powerful Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Elias Colston. Soon after McHugh leaves, Colston's wife returns home to find her husband shot to death in their garage. McHugh has no recollection of committing the crime and no one who would possibly believe in his innocence, other than Lou. As more facts come to light, even Lou has serious doubts. But something about McHugh's story nags at him and as he looks into matters, pieces of the puzzle don't point to his friend's guilt so definitively. </p><p>With the help of Sarah Cooper, an ambitious attorney with her own reasons for hating doctors, Lou finds himself at the center of a deadly, high-level conspiracy where the difference between right and wrong is a matter of interpretation, and the words "whatever it takes" have a chilling meaning. If Lou and Sarah don't uncover the real reasons Colston is dead, they may not survive themselves, and the entire country could be at risk for attacks that could destroy the very fabric of national security.</p><p>Once again, bestselling author Michael Palmer proves that he is the king of suspense in this page-turning thriller, <i>Political Suicide</i>, set at the crossroads of politics, the military, and medical science.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Palmer</b> (1942-2013) wrote internationally bestselling novels of medical suspense, including <i>The First Patient</i>, <i>The Second Opinion</i>, <i>The Last Surgeon</i>, <i>A Heartbeat Away</i>, <i>Oath of Office</i> and <i>Political Suicide</i>. His book <i>Extreme Measures</i> was adapted into a movie starring Hugh Grant and Gene Hackman. His books have been translated into thirty-five languages. Palmer earned his bachelor's degree at Wesleyan University, and he attended medical school at Case Western Reserve University. He trained in internal medicine at Boston City and Massachusetts General Hospitals. He spent twenty years as a full-time practitioner of internal and emergency medicine. In addition to his writing, Palmer was an associate director of the Massachusetts Medical Society Physician Health Services, devoted to helping physicians troubled by mental illness, physical illness, behavioral issues, and chemical dependency. He lived in eastern Massachusetts.</p>Dr. Lou Welcome, who supervises other doctors through the Physician Wellness Office, is shocked to discover that a friend and colleague might be mixed up in the homicide of a U.S. congressman. Not willing to accept that his friend is a murderer, Lou starts digging only to uncover a deadly conspiracy. If this all sounds a bit familiar, it&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s pretty much the same story, with minor variations, as Oath of Office (2012), which introduced Welcome, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, which explains why he&#x2019;s not supervising other doctors with troubled histories. It&#x2019;s not a bad book, but like its predecessor, it misses several opportunities for surprising plot twists and has the overall feeling of been-there, done-that (too many times). Palmer can be a talented and original storyteller, but of late his writing feels lethargic, and his stories repetitive and predictable. Devoted readers might enjoy this one, but it won&#x2019;t win him any new fans. --David Pitt</p><h2>The Earth Is the Lord&#39;s: The Inner World of the Jew in Eastern Europe (A Jewish Lights Classic Reprint)</h2><p><p><b>Powerfully and beautifully portrays a bygone Jewish culture. </b></p><p>The story about the life of the Jews in Eastern Europe which has come to an end in our days is what I have tried to tell in this essay. I have not talked about their books, their art or institutions, but about their daily life, about their habits and customs, about their attitudes toward the basic things in life, about the scale of values which directed their aspirations....</p><blockquote><p>"In this period our people attained the highest degree of inwardness.... It was the golden period in Jewish history, in the history of the Jewish soul."<br>&#x2015;from <em>The Earth Is the Lord's</em></p></blockquote><p></p></p><p><i>The Earth Is the Lord's</i> by Abraham Joshua Heschel is a story about the daily life of Jews in Eastern Europe before the 20th century. "I have not talked about their books, their art or institutions," Heschel writes in the book's preface, "but about their ... customs, about their attitudes toward the basic things in life, about the scale of values which directed their aspirations." Spare, elegant woodcut illustrations by Ilya Schor complement Heschel's text, deepening its preoccupation with intangibles. (One chapter, for example, describes an indelibly Jewish trait, "The Sigh.") The parallelisms of Heschel's prose are mesmerizing: "Pagans exalt sacred things, the Prophets extol sacred deeds;" "The stone is broken, but the words are alive." There are stories of a seraph in a synagogue, of scholars closing their books and wandering away from home in self-imposed exile, of a rabbi who spent days staring at the same page of the Talmud. ("I feel so good here," he said, "why should I go elsewhere?") The facts of each vignette are suffused with purpose so that when Heschel states his book's reason for being, it seems the most natural thing in the world: "Loyal to the presence of the ultimate in the common, we may be able to make it clear that man is more than man, that in doing the finite he may perceive the infinite." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Not only Jews, but all who regard the culture of the inner life as important will find this book moving and meaningful.<br> VirginiaKirkus</p><h2>The Slaves&#39; War: The Civil War in the Words of Former Slaves</h2><p>The first narrative history of the Civil War told by the very people it freed<br><br>Groundbreaking, compelling, and poignant, The Slaves&#x2019; War delivers an unprecedented vision of the nation&#x2019;s bloodiest conflict. An acclaimed historian of nineteenth-century and African-American history, Andrew Ward gives us the first narrative of the Civil War told from the perspective of those whose destiny it decided. Woven together from hundreds of interviews, diaries, letters, and memoirs, here is the Civil War as seen from not only battlefields, capitals, and camps, but also slave quarters, kitchens, roadsides, farms, towns, and swamps. Speaking in a quintessentially American language of wit, candor, and biblical power, army cooks and launderers, runaways, teamsters, and gravediggers bring the war to vivid life.<br>From slaves&#x2019; theories about the causes of the war to their frank assessments of such major figures as Lincoln, Davis, Lee, and Grant; from their searing memories of the carnage of battle to their often startling attitudes toward masters and liberators alike; and from their initial jubilation at the Yankee invasion of the slave South to the crushing disappointment of freedom&#x2019;s promise unfulfilled, The Slaves&#x2019; War is a transformative and engrossing vision of America&#x2019;s Second Revolution.<br></p><p>ANDREW WARD, a writer for television, an essayist for the Atlantic, National Public Radio&#x2019;s All Things Considered, and the Washington Post, concluded that he would never understand this country until he understood the history and legacy of slavery. Researching his award-winning accounts of the roots of the African-American spiritual in Dark Midnight When I Rise and a Civil War massacre of black troops in River Run Red, Ward kept encountering former slaves&#x2019; astonishing reminiscences of the war. Amazed that no one had assembled their testimony into a narrative of the conflict that set them free, he has sifted through thousands of eyewitness accounts of every major episode and personage to create a headlong and deeply human chronicle of the bloodiest war in American history.<br>PROLOGUE We DoneNow&#x201d; Fort Sumter Gladness and Lamentation<br><br>Well before sunrise on Friday, April 12, 1861, George Gregory joined a group of his fellow slaves on the Charleston waterfront and gazed across the harbor at Fort Sumter&#x2019;s dismal, hulking silhouette. Sumter&#x2019;s commander, Major Robert Anderson, had been holding out since the previous December, refusing demand after demand that he turn the fort over to Secessionist South Carolina. Now his time was up. Abe Lincoln had sent the word that he going to send provisions to the fort,&#x201d; recalled a local slave named Josh Miles, and the whole town of Charleston&#x201d; went down to see the first shot fired.&#x201d; White Charlestonians darted around crying, Everybody get back! The fort will fire on the town and kill every person,&#x201d; Gregory remembered. But nobody care, cause they figure if one going to be killed, they all going to be, and it don&#x2019;t make a difference no-how. And just as the light commence making the sky red, and it&#x2019;s light enough to see who that is standing by you BOOM! the first gun went off!&#x201d; from the Secessionist batteries. The light from it shone in the sky, and made it redder! The war done commence,&#x201d; and all around Gregory the folks shout, and some cry, and some sing.&#x201d; That morning William H. Robinson was driving his master and a companion to Wilmington, North Carolina, when they heard the booming of cannons echoing down the Cape Fear river&#x201d; and across the broad bosom of the Atlantic.&#x201d; Slapping his hands together with a curse, his master looked deathly pale&#x201d; as he turned to his friend and said simply, It&#x2019;s come.&#x201d; He hastily jotted a note and handed it to Robinson to take back to his mistress. But as was his habit with all his master&#x2019;s mail, Robinson stopped first at the cabin of a literate slave named Tom to hear it read aloud. We have fired on Fort Sumter,&#x201d; it said. I may possibly be called away to help whip the Yankees; may be gone three days, but not longer than that.&#x201d; Robinson&#x2019;s master went on to instruct his wife to tell their overseer to keep a very close watch on the Negroes, and see that there&#x2019;s no private talk among them,&#x201d; and to give two local whites suspected of abolitionist tendencies no opportunity to talk with the Negroes.&#x201d; Soon after the firing on Fort Sumter, Louis Hughes was waiting with his team outside a store in Pontotoc, Mississippi, when his owner emerged. What do you think?&#x201d; blustered master Ed McGee, climbing into his carriage. Old Abraham Lincoln has called for 75,000 men to come to Washington immediately. Well, let them come,&#x201d; he snarled, we will make a breakfast of them. I can whip a half dozen Yankees with my pocket knife.&#x201d; Arriving home, McGee instituted daily pistol practice that required Hughes to run over and check the target after each of his master&#x2019;s rounds. He would sometimes miss the fence entirely, the ball going out into the woods beyond,&#x201d; but when he managed to shoot within the bull&#x2019;s eye&#x2019;s vicinity, he would exclaim, Ah! I would have got him that time,&#x201d; by which he meant a Yankee soldier. It seemed to Hughes that there was something very ludicrous in this pistol practice of a man who boasted that he could whip half a dozen Yankees with a jackknife.&#x201d;<br><br>When Sumter fell, recalled Sam Aleckson of South Carolina, in the big house there was gladness and rejoicing, while at the quarters there was groaning and lamentation.&#x201d; His fellow slaves believed that as long as Major Anderson held Fort Sumter, their prospects were at least hopeful; but when Sumter fell, they felt that their hopes were all in vain.&#x201d; We done now,&#x201d; they kept repeating. But then an old slave named Ben stepped forward to declare that though the white folks could laugh now,&#x201d; slaves should wait till by and by.&#x201d; When a young slave eyewitness to Anderson&#x2019;s surrender drew himself up&#x201d; and imitated the major declaring to the Rebels that if I had food for my men, and ammunition, I be damned if I would let you come in those gates!&#x201d; Ben&#x2019;s wife, Lucy, took heart. Amen! Bless the Lord!&#x201d; she cried, and admonished her fellows to hope and pray.&#x201d; Their master took Aleckson and Uncle Ben to Charleston, where they found whites going about the streets wearing blue cockades on the lapels of their coats. These were the minute men,&#x2019; and the refrain was frequently heard, Blue cockade and rusty gun / We&#x2019;ll make those Yankees run like fun.&#x2019;&#x201d; One day young Aleckson overheard recruits saying they were on their way to the Front.&#x2019;&#x201d; Uncle Ben,&#x201d; Aleckson asked, where&#x2019;s the front&#x2019;?&#x201d; The old man made no immediate reply,&#x201d; but eventually looked up at young Aleckson with a scowl. The front is the Devil,&#x201d; he said, and returned to his chores.<br><br>1 Before TheirTime&#x201d; Harbingers oofWar John Brown Masters&#x2019; Panic Abraham Lincoln<br><br>Now everything was stirred up for a long spell before the war to free us come on,&#x201d; said TTTTTemple Wilson. For well over a decade, the nation had been roiling over the slavery issue. Though the Compromise of 1850 had reinforced the Fugitive Slave Act, which required Northerners to assist in returning escaped slaves to their masters, and despite various Northern states&#x2019; efforts to exclude them, thousands of escaped slaves continued to seek refuge above the Mason-Dixon Line. In 1854, the Republican Party was founded to campaign against the extension of slavery into free territories. Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which held that the settlers living in the two territories could determine for themselves whether they would join the Union as free or slave states. The result was a savage war between proslavery and abolitionist �migr�s that would result in hundreds of deaths. A year later, several Northern states enacted laws forbidding state officials to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act. In 1856, as slaves in seven Southern states revolted against their masters, abolitionist Charles Sumner of Massachusetts was almost caned to death for denouncing slavery on the floor of the Senate. The following year, the Supreme Court ruled that an escaped slave named Dred Scott remained his master&#x2019;s property and therefore could not sue for citizenship in the North. And all the while there had been the rising, accelerating drumbeat of Northern abolitionists on the one side and Southern apostles of disunion on the other.<br> As their masters waxed hysterical about Yankee agitation, many of their slaves sought prophecy in signs and omens. It was talked and threatened and all kinds of bad signs pointed to war,&#x201d; said Temple Wilson, till at last they just knowed it was bound to come on.&#x201d; I saw the elements all red as blood,&#x201d; recalled Frank Patterson, and I saw after that a great comet; and they said there was gonna be a war.&#x201d; Harriet Gresham of Florida recalled that there were hordes of ants, and everyone said this was an omen of war.&#x201d; One night before the war come,&#x201d; Dora Jackson&#x2019;s mother and some other women was washing clothes down at a creek, when all at once they look up at the sky, and they see guns and swords&#x201d; streak across the firmament and stack themselves together. They was so scared they run to the house and call old Master and tell him about it. He laughed at them and told them they was just imagining things, but it was just a few days before the war come, and they saw them guns just like they did in the sky.&#x201d; In the winter of 1860 to 1861, Mississippi experienced the worst freeze that us had ever had,&#x201d; recalled Liza Strickland. The limbs of the trees got so heavy with ice till they broke off. It sounded like guns firing.&#x201d; Strickland knew right then and there that was a bad sign, and a war was sure coming, and when it did break out us weren&#x2019;t surprised at all, and us had to stay scared to death for four long years.&#x201d; Before the war I seen troubles in this land,&#x201d; declared Lu Perkins of Texas. I seen a big black wave of hating going on over the land and the folks getting poorer and poorer and starving for the childrens and the old.&#x201d; Perkins had a vision of new kinds of soldiers and folks fighting till blood run over the land,&#x201d; starting in the far corner of the world and spread over the country&#x201d; the judgment, she said, for folks being mean and greedy.&#x201d; One night she awoke and saw a blazing star dragging its long tail along the ground,&#x201d; whereupon a white man ran out into the night crying, Judgment! Judgment is on us!&#x201d;<br><br>In the east the first concrete sign that something momentous was at hand came in the fall of 1859 when a shard from the war for Kansas arced eastward. After leading murderous raids on proslavery encampments along the Missouri border, the abolitionist John Brown and a party of whites and freed blacks set out to spark a servile insurrection by attacking the Federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia.<br> Jared Maurice Arter&#x2019;s master had departed for work as the arsenal&#x2019;s inspector of arms when Arter heard that Brown and a party of freedmen had galloped through the county on the previous night, taken into custody a number of the leading citizens, captured Harpers Ferry and the arsenal, and barricaded himself and his men in the engine-house,&#x201d; where they were holding the captured citizens as prisoners.&#x201d; Arter recalled that all the day long, groups of men on horseback, armed with revolvers, shot guns, and rifles, could be seen going towards Harpers Ferry, the scene of excitement.&#x201d; But these vigilantes accomplished nothing,&#x201d; and it would take Colonel Robert E. Lee and a squadron of marines to dislodge Brown and his comrades. Lee&#x2019;s young slave Jim Parke recalled sitting on his master&#x2019;s broad veranda at Arlington when a soldier rode up. Been driving his horse hard,&#x201d; Parke recalled. The Colonel come to the door, and took some papers, and read them. He look right solemn-like.&#x201d; Parke&#x2019;s sister overheard Lee telling his wife to spread the word among the servants&#x201d; that he had to go catch John Brown and all his men.&#x201d; The soldiers marched right in front of our house,&#x201d; recalled Frank Smith of Virginia, right by the front gate, when they was going to Harpers Ferry to kill Old John Brown.&#x201d; Two days after his raid commenced, Brown was captured and eventually condemned to death. According to Hillary Watson, Brown declared that though you Southern people can hang me,&#x201d; the cause he was dying for was going to win, and there&#x2019;ll soon be a man here for every strand I&#x2019;ve got on my head, fighting to free the slaves.&#x201d; The excitement ran so high and fear was so great&#x201d; that Brown&#x2019;s Northern supporters might attempt to rescue him, that few persons except strong men were permitted to witness the execution.&#x201d; But nine-year-old Arter stood beside my mother, holding to her apron, and saw hanged four of Brown&#x2019;s men&#x201d; in a scene Arter remembered as very war-like.&#x201d; John Brown&#x2019;s failure fortified many slaves&#x2019; belief that only God, not man, could free them, and in His own good time. Pharaoh Chesney concluded that Brown&#x2019;s fanaticism&#x201d; made him a victim to an ill-timed movement,&#x201d; and that abolition suffered more from such abortive steps than from the combined arguments of the pro-slavery men.&#x201d; Frank Smith believed simply that Brown was killing white folks&#x201d; and freeing slaves before their time.&#x201d; What God says has got to come, comes,&#x201d; said Jerry Eubanks of Mississippi. This is written in the Bible.&#x201d; White people might regard Emancipation as the work of man, but colored people looks cross years at everything. God did it all.&#x201d; According to what was issued out in the Bible,&#x201d; Charlie Aarons testified, there was a time for slavery, people had to be punished for their sin, and then there was a time for it not to be.&#x201d;<br><br> It was impossible to keep the news of John Brown&#x2019;s attack on Harpers Ferry from spreading,&#x201d; recalled George Albright of Mississippi. A literate slave named Sam Hall remembered the thrill of fear that passed through his master&#x2019;s community in North Carolina. It was suspicioned by the whites&#x201d; that their slaves planned to organize an uprising&#x201d; and had chosen Hall to command them; and Hall did not know at what moment I might be led out by the whites and hanged.&#x201d; The attack on Harpers Ferry threw a scare into the slave owners,&#x201d; Albright remembered. One day not long after the arrest of Brown, a boy in a nearby orchard shot off a pop gun, and my mistress ran in terror to the house, screaming that the insurrectionists were coming.&#x201d; As their fathers had done after Nat Turner&#x2019;s abortive slave rebellion thirty years before, masters cracked down on their slaves in John Brown&#x2019;s wake. Suddenly they enforced to the letter longstanding but hitherto loosely observed laws against black assemblies, literacy, gun ownership, and alcohol consumption. Some of the slaveholders would double the proportion of work,&#x201d; recalledWilliam Henry Towns. They just whipped the slaves so much to keep them cowed down, and cause they might have fought for freedom much sooner.&#x201d; A slave from Paris, Tennessee, said that as a young boy he did not realize he was a slave until just before the war, when local whites cut Darkies&#x2019; heads off in a riot&#x201d; and put their faces up like a sign board.&#x201d;<br><br>Brown&#x2019;s raid may have failed to spark a slave uprising, but in the fall of 1860 many Southern whites regarded the election of Black Republican&#x201d; Abraham Lincoln as an even graver threat to slavery. I think it has come to a pretty pass, that old Lincoln,&#x201d; Mattie Jackson&#x2019;s mistress harrumphed, with his long legs, an old rail splitter&#x201d; intended to put black people on an equality with the whites.&#x201d; Before she would see her children on such a footing, she said, she had rather see them dead.&#x201d; In their recollections, a number of former slaves would claim to have laid eyes on Lincoln before the war. Some may well have encountered not the Abraham Lincoln but his cousin and contemporary of the same name, or perhaps an English immigrant named William Ellaby Lincoln, a somewhat unbalanced Oberlin College theological student who roamed the South before the CivilWar, preaching against the sins of slavery.<br> But it was not the flesh-and-blood Lincoln former slaves conjured so much as a furtive abolitionist phantom swirling through Dixie, stirring up slaves and masters. Not long before the war began, Margret Hulm answered her master&#x2019;s door, and there stood a big man with a gray blanket around him for a cape. He had a string tied around his neck to hold it on. A part of it was turned down over the string like a ghost cape. He had on jeans pants and big mud boots and a big black hat: kind of like men wear now. He stayed all night. We treated him nice like we did everybody when they come to our house. We heard after he was gone that he was Abraham Lincoln, and he was a spy.&#x201d; Lincoln came to North Carolina and ate breakfast with my master,&#x201d; recalled Frank Patterson. As he pitched into his ham with cream gravy made out of sweet milk,&#x201d; biscuits, poached eggs on toast, coffee and tea, and grits,&#x201d; a presumably sated Lincoln nevertheless warned his host that if whites descended to conceiving children by slaves&#x201d; and then buying and selling their own blood,&#x201d; it would have to be stopped.&#x201d; I knowed the time when Abraham Lincoln come to the plantation,&#x201d; Alice Douglass insisted. He come through there on the train and stopped overnight once.&#x201d; Some slaves shined his shoes, some cooked for him, and I waited on the table; I can&#x2019;t forget that. We had chicken hash and batter cakes and dried venison that day. You be sure we knowed he was our friend, and we catched what he had to say.&#x201d; She would never forget so long as I live&#x201d; his parting words to her master: If you free the people, I&#x2019;ll bring you back into the Union.&#x201d; But if you don&#x2019;t free your slaves,&#x201d; he said, I&#x2019;ll whip you back into the Union.&#x201d; Another story had it that Lincoln had turned against slavery after his wife witnessed the flogging of a pregnant slave in Richmond. Mrs. Lincoln was horrified at the situation and expressed herself as being so,&#x201d; Irene Coates contended...</p><h2>Look and Find: Marvel Heroes (Look and Find)</h2><p>Look and Find: Marvel Heroes allows children to join their favorite Marvel Comics superheroes on a thrilling adventure to save the world.

His novels have twice been shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize (The Good Doctor; In A Strange Room), and The Impostor was shortlisted for the Dublin/IMPAC Award and the Commonwealth Writers&#39; Prize, which Galgut also won with The Good Doctor.Starred Review. There&#39;s a lot of travel in Booker Prize finalist Galgut&#39;s (The Good Doctor) new novel, but he&#39;s more interested in depicting the randomness, heightened sensitivity, dread, and possibility that come from unfamiliar places than in seeing the sights. A South African man travels in Greece, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Tanzania, and India, forming the complicated, tenuous relationships that provide the book&#39;s three sections titles (Follower; Lover; Guardian). This character, who bears the author&#39;s name and seems to share his history, is both &#34;he&#34; and &#34;I.&#34; Though these shifts can occur in the space of a sentence, they&#39;re surprisingly easy to accept, and attentive readers will get a subtle, frank depiction of some of the problems of writing; &#34;he&#34; seems to be Galgut, but often experiences himself as divided, uncertain, and blurry as a fictional character evading his creator, &#34;I&#34; often steps in to remind us of the limits of memory and the artificiality of genre distinctions. At its best Galgut&#39;s tale has the feel of arriving in a destination you&#39;d never planned to go.

Today he is remembered through the photographs he left behind as well as the thousands of notes and letters--funny, angry, and always eloquent--that detail a life of passion and determination. He took risks, spoke his mind, and championed an oversized cause. His rebellion against the shortsighted disregard of an American genius, the architect Louis Sullivan, appeals to a new generation interested in conservation--whether of old buildings or natural resources. This book is a collection of more than 200 letters and photographs that will inspire and intrigue readers. Images of Chicago buildings include the Garrick Building, the Chicago Stock Exchange, and the Auditorium Theater. Images of American buildings include Frank Lloyd Wright&#39;s Price Tower in Oklahoma and Louis Sullivan&#39;s banks in Iowa and Ohio.</p><p>Richard Nickel was among America&#x2019;s early militant architectural preservationists.

Triggered by a tip from an American spymaster in 1987 while researching his <i>I Pledge Allegiance ... The True Story Of The Walkers: An American Spy Family</i>, this work of journalism uncovers decades of government duplicity regarding its investigations of reported extraterrestrial visits. With 212 interviews and some 200 published sources, author Howard Blum's earnest reporting is a gripping and credible documentation of his journey from skepticism to belief.Blum ( I Pledge Allegiance ) here offers a curious amalgam of science and apparent science fiction, ranging in subject from the bona fide quests of SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) astrophysicists and radio astronomers to unverified reports of UFO sightings and the barmy project of a tiny Wisconsin town to build a landing site for flying saucers. But what is most arresting about his study is Blum's claim that the U.S. government has been gathering information about UFOs since 1947, with one or two hiatuses--and has kept these investigations secret. The culprits seem to be top military men, portrayed here as paranoid children, and members of our various spy operations. The book should cause a stir among readers kept far too long in the dark.

For more than three&nbsp;months now she&#x2019;s been barricaded inside&nbsp;this castle in Oxford while her cousin,&nbsp;Stephen, circles the ramparts with his men, waits for&nbsp;slow starvation to force her out and into his capture.&nbsp;They have eaten all the horses and burnt all the&nbsp;furniture. They have retreated through pockets of&nbsp;cold, to a small room without windows at the base of&nbsp;the tower. At night they huddle together like dogs.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Matilda is Queen of England, but her cousin has&nbsp;stolen the Crown, and now she is locked into battle&nbsp;with him. She has been locked into battle with him&nbsp;for almost seven years.&nbsp;<br><br>Stephen would never have been able to race to&nbsp;London to claim the Crown if Matilda had been in&nbsp;England at the time, not stranded in France with her&nbsp;child husband, Geoffrey of Anjou, who everyone&nbsp;agreed had descended from the daughter of Satan.&nbsp;She would never have had to marry a fourteen-yearold&nbsp;if her brother, William, had lived, instead of&nbsp;drowning in the Channel in 1120 on the White Ship,&nbsp;rowed across by drunken men who, in their drunkenness,&nbsp;hit a rock and holed the boat. Their father,&nbsp;Henry I, King of England, was so grief-stricken that&nbsp;he never smiled again, and decided to pass on the&nbsp;throne to his daughter, Matilda, even though it was&nbsp;unheard of for a woman to inherit the Crown and&nbsp;govern the realm.&nbsp;<br><br>Matilda would never have had to think about&nbsp;being Queen if her father hadn&#x2019;t died suddenly. Her&nbsp;father wouldn&#x2019;t have died suddenly if he&#x2019;d listened to&nbsp;everyone around him and not eaten such a huge&nbsp;helping of stewed lamprey eels.&nbsp;<br><br>It is night at Oxford Castle. UsuallyMatilda makes&nbsp;the rounds, visits her men slouched by the narrow&nbsp;windows, their longbows leaned up against the&nbsp;stone, but tonight she is too weary, cannot think of&nbsp;anything appropriate to cheer them further onwards&nbsp;in her service, towards their very deaths, so she goes&nbsp;instead into the interior of the castle to find her&nbsp;maid, who will prepare her for sleep.&nbsp;<br><br>Her maid, Jane, is not in the room at the base of&nbsp;the tower. Matilda finds her out in the courtyard,&nbsp;staring up at the sky, Matilda&#x2019;s nightshirt slung over&nbsp;her arm.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Look, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; she says, as soon as she sees the&nbsp;Queen. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s snowing.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>So it is. Big, lacy flakes that swim down out of the&nbsp;darkness decorate the shoulders of the Queen&#x2019;s&nbsp;maid.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; says Jane. &#x201c;The snow is the same colour&nbsp;as your nightshirt.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>Matilda takes her three strongest knights. They&nbsp;make a rope out of their leggings and they wait until&nbsp;the hour is the darkest, the snow is the thickest. They&nbsp;are lowered to the ground from one of the castle&nbsp;windows by the men they have left behind. All four&nbsp;of them are dressed in nightshirts and they move&nbsp;like ghosts, softly and slowly, towards the edge of&nbsp;the river.&nbsp;<br><br>The Thames is frozen. Matilda saw it freeze.&nbsp;These days and days of the siege, she has spent a good&nbsp;deal of time looking out at the enemy camped on the&nbsp;edge of the river. A week ago the temperature&nbsp;dropped, and now Stephen&#x2019;s men walk up and down&nbsp;the ice on horseback. They have even built two fires&nbsp;there, near the shore.&nbsp;<br><br>In order to get to the other side of the river,&nbsp;Matilda and her three men will have to walk between&nbsp;those signal fires. They move in single file, a man in&nbsp;front, then Matilda, two men behind her. They&nbsp;move slowly and carefully, do not speak, keep close&nbsp;together.&nbsp;<br><br>Through the swirling snow, Matilda can see the&nbsp;glow of the fires, can hear the voices of Stephen&#x2019;s&nbsp;army. If they can just pass between those fires they&nbsp;will cross to the middle of the river, out past the sentries,&nbsp;and from there they can walk to the other side.&nbsp;Matilda is equally opposed and equally supported by&nbsp;the people of Britain, and there will be someone who&nbsp;will help them, give them horses so they can ride&nbsp;to Wallingford, where her ally, Brien FitzCount, is&nbsp;waiting.&nbsp;<br><br>They are almost at the fires when a sentry on&nbsp;horseback comes towards them. They instantly stop,&nbsp;locked into position, heads bowed against their&nbsp;chests. They are wearing white bonnets and white&nbsp;nightgowns. The snow erases their bodies, but perhaps&nbsp;it doesn&#x2019;t completely erase their outlines, for&nbsp;the sentry halts before them. Matilda can hear the&nbsp;horse breathing, can hear it snort. The horse knows&nbsp;that they&#x2019;re there. She raises her head a little, can&nbsp;make out the upright figure of the man in the saddle.&nbsp;She sees him lift his arm, thinks he is going for his&nbsp;sword, but he blesses himself instead, blesses himself&nbsp;and rides right past them.

She&#x2019;s learned how to watch and wait. She&#x2019;s&nbsp;learned how to choose what burns, how much heat&nbsp;there will be in her maid&#x2019;s sewing box, in the wooden&nbsp;bowl that used to hold apples. She saw the river&nbsp;freeze, that moment when the water took hold of&nbsp;itself and wouldn&#x2019;t let go. All this time she thought&nbsp;the siege was chaos, but she can see now that it was&nbsp;really calm masquerading as chaos. If she gets away,&nbsp;the control she thinks she has in riding to&nbsp;Wallingford, in going back into battle against&nbsp;Stephen &#x2014; that will prove to be the real chaos.&nbsp;<br><br>Matilda holds her breath.

Juneau in 1942, in which nearly seven hundred lives were lost</p><p>From Kurzman (Fatal Voyage, A Killing Wind, etc.), a telling rundown on a WW II disaster that seldom rates more than a footnote in standard chronicles. On the night of November 12, 1942, a small American flotilla engaged in a furious battle with Japanese warships off Guadalcanal. The next morning, while the surviving US vessels were limping toward safe harbor, a torpedo from an undetected submarine slammed into the already crippled Juneau. The missile touched off below- deck explosions that sent the light cruiser to the bottom in seconds. Convinced that all hands had been lost, the task force commander maintained radio silence and cleared the area. As it happened, however, over 140 of the doomed ship's 700-man crew lived through the blast and were plunged into the shark-infested sea: when a belated rescue effort was launched almost a week later, there were only ten barely sane castaways left to save. Drawing on interviews with survivors and on archival sources, Kurzman offers harrowing tales of the ordeals experienced by the quick and the dead; among the latter were all five brothers from the Waterloo, Iowa, Sullivan family, who (against naval policy) had served together on a single craft. Addressed as well are the oversights and blunders that, despite repeated aerial sightings, delayed a systematic recovery operation that probably could have saved a hundred or more sailors. While punishments were quietly meted out to culpable officers, the author notes that the home front (diverted by sympathetic coverage of the Sullivans' loss) never received a full accounting of a calamity that ranks among the most agonizing in the annals of the US military. Kurzman's evenhanded and absorbing report not only bridges a long-standing gap in the history books but pays fitting tribute to those lost. (Photos--16 pages--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>On November 13, 1942, during the naval battle of Guadalcanal, a Japanese submarine torpedoed the cruiser U.S.S. Juneau , killing most of its 700-plus crew. Some 150 survivors watched in dismay as the rest of the task force sailed over the horizon, its commander, Captain Gilbert C. Hoover, having decided that it was too dangerous to pick them up. Due to communications foul-ups combined with gross negligence, rescuers did not arrive until eight days later, by which time only 10 Juneau crewmen remained alive. Kurzman's skillful recounting of the nightmarish events in the water, reconstructed from interviews with five of the survivors and with relatives of the other five will not be soon forgotten by readers--especially the horrifying shark frenzies. The book reveals details of the Navy's investigation and its decision to quietly bury the tragic story with this official statement: "Let the Juneau be remembered simply as the ill-fated ship on which the celebrated Sullivan brothers courageously died fighting when it went down, bringing new glory on the U.S. Navy." The author of the acclaimed Fatal Voyage: The Sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis has re-created another memorable disaster story. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Statistical Methods For Research Workers</h2><p>ABOUT THE BOOK:- It was probably one of the most comprehensive of all books on Statistics designed specially for the research workers of 20th century.

Michelangelo Buonarroti never wanted to paint the Sistine Chapel, though. Appointed by the temperamental Julius II, Michelangelo believed the suspiciously large-scale project to be a plot for failure conspired by his rivals and the "Warrior Pope." After all, Michelangelo was not a painter&#x2014;he was a sculptor. The noble artist reluctantly took on the daunting task that would damage his neck, back, and eyes (if you have ever strained to admire the real thing, you know). Andrew Graham-Dixon tells the story behind the famous painted ceiling over which the great artist painfully toiled for four long years.<br><br> Linking Michelangelo's personal life to his work on the Sistine Chapel, Graham-Dixon describes Michelangelo's unique depiction of the Book of Genesis, tackles ambiguities in the work, and details the painstaking work that went into Michelangelo's magnificent creation. Complete with rich, full-color illustrations and Graham-Dixon's articulate narrative, <i>Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel</i> is an indispensable and significant piece of art criticism. It humanizes this heavenly masterpiece in a way that every art enthusiast, student, and professional can understand and appreciate.</p><p><b>Andrew Graham-Dixon</b> has presented six landmark series on art for the BBC, including the acclaimed <i>A History of British Art, Renaissance</i> and <i>Art of Eternity</i>, as well as numerous individual documentaries on art and artists. For more than twenty years he has published a weekly column on art, first in the <i>Independent</i> and, more recently, in the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>. He has written a number of acclaimed books, on subjects ranging from medieval painting and sculpture to the art of the present, including <i>Caravaggio: A Life Sacred and Profane,&nbsp;Art: The Definitive Visual Guide,</i> and <i>Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel</i>.&#34;unravels the aesthetic originality behind... familiar figures.&#34; OBSERVER &#34;an engaging and accessible introduction... the way he sets out this historical context, establishing for his readers the ongoing economic, social and political events that did so much to shape the building of the city and therefore the creation of a masterpiece... a model of understated scholarship packed into a convenient size - physically as well as intellectually - with good colour photography and all at a very reasonable price: what more can the general reader hope for.&#34; SUNDAY TELEGRAPH &#34;an excellent introduction to the Sistine Chapel... Time and again while reading this book I found myself looking with fresh eyes at a detail of the ceiling, prompted by an arresting phrase or astute observation... This is art history at its best: clear, exciting, well-informed.&#34; -- CRAIG BROWN&#39;S BOOK OF THE WEEK MAIL ON SUNDAY &#34;shows the best of what Graham-Dixon brings to his art criticism: an easy facility to convey the complex in lucid, simple terms.&#34; -- SERENA DAVIES DAILY TELEGRAPH &#34;From first to last, it is crisply written in a prose which is both brisk and shapely... such a user guide to the brilliant particularities of the Sistine Chapel, aimed at the intelligent general reader, fills a gap in the market.&#34; RA MAGAZINE &#34;Andrew Graham Dixon penetrates the many layers of meaning surrounding Michelangelo&#39;s rich images and allows us to glimpse something of the visions perceived by the artist himself. But more than this, he reveals Michelangelo the man - an achievement which ultimately proves even more rewarding.&#34; YORKSHIRE EVENING POST</p><h2>What&#39;s Happening to Me?: Boys Edition</h2><p>A guide to puberty for boys discusses the changes that occur, covering such topics as height, skin, facial hair, the reproductive system, eating, exercise, hormones, sex, relationships, and what happens to girls during puberty.</p><p></p><h2>If He Hollers Let Him Go: A Novel</h2><p>This story of a man living every day in fear of his life for simply being black is as powerful today as it was when it was first published in 1947. The novel takes place in the space of four days in the life of Bob Jones, a black man who is constantly plagued by the effects of racism. Living in a society that is drenched in race consciousness has no doubt taken a toll on the way Jones behaves, thinks, and feels, especially when, at the end of his story, he is accused of a brutal crime he did not commit. "One of the most important American writers of the twentieth century ... [a] quirky American genius..."&#x2014;Walter Mosley, author of Bad Boy Brawly Brown, Devil in a Blue Dress "If He Hollers is an austere and concentrated study of black experience, set in southern California in the early forties."&#x2014;Independent Publisher</p><p>In the decades just prior to the eruption of the American civil rights movement in the late '50s, Chester Himes was one of the most significant African American authors--although today he is less well known than several of his contemporaries. He wrote numerous novels, short stories, essays, and a powerful, searing autobiography, and he did so with an economy of language, a graceful eloquence, and a painful yet unflinching directness.<p> <i>If He Hollers Let Him Go</i> places Himes in the pantheon of 20th-century novelists. It is an intense and muscular story, with an assembly of characters drawn from virtually every social and economic class present in Southern California in the '40s. The novel takes place over four days in the life of Bob Jones, the only black foreman in a shipyard during World War II. Jones lives in a society literally drenched in race consciousness--every conversation in a bar, every personal relationship, every instruction given on a job site, every casual glance on a sidewalk, every interaction of any kind, no matter how trivial, is imbued with a painful and dangerous meaning. A slight mistake, an unwitting rebellion, an unintentional expression of rage or desire can spell disaster for a black man--a beating over a game of craps, or an arrest, or termination from a job, or an accusation of rape. Jones awakes each day in fear, and lives steeped in fear: </p><blockquote>It came along with consciousness. It came into my head first, somewhere back of my closed eyes, moved slowly underneath my skull to the base of my brain, cold and hollow. It seeped down my spine, into my arms, spread through my groin with an almost sexual torture, settled in my stomach like butterfly wings. For a moment I felt torn all loose inside, shriveled, paralyzed, as if after awhile I'd have to get up and die.</blockquote> For Jones, there is no escape from the constant drumbeat of race and racism. It invades his dreams, his tiniest aspirations, and his deepest passions. Every attempt to retaliate or defend himself leads only to further trouble, loss, or humiliation. He can never forget who he is or what he is prevented from being. At the same time, he comes across as an actor, a subject, a doer, and not as a hapless, helpless victim. For all that he is confronted with, he never stops planning and acting and moving, and in the end, he survives, though his escape is incomplete and bittersweet.<p> The very idea that Jones can escape, however, marks a revolution in American literature. Thwarted at nearly every turn, he is nonetheless a powerful, intelligent, complicated agent of his own destiny. This 1945 novel is a compelling read, and Chester Himes deserves to be remembered for far more than <i>Cotton Comes to Harlem</i> and the raft of hard-bitten detective novels with which he made his living. <i>--Andrew Himes</i></p>Chester Himes was born in Missouri in 1909 and died in Spain in 1984. He wrote several acclaimed Harlem thrillers and novels, including The Crazy Kill, The Real Cool Killers, Cotton Comes to Harlem, Lovely Crusade and an autobiography, The Quality of Hurt.</p><h2>The Christian Faith: In the Doctrinal Documents of the Catholic Church</h2><p>Doctrinal documents of the Catholic Church.</p><p></p><h2>Dune Messiah</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

And you must be Danielle?&#x201d; Sleek and small, her wide eyes rendered enormous by kohl, Lucy Leverett, in spite of her resemblance to a baby seal, rasped impressively. Her dangling fan earrings clanked at her neck as she leaned in to kiss each of them, Danielle too, and although she held her cigarette, in its mother-of-pearl holder, at arm&#x2019;s length, its smoke wafted between them and brought tears to Danielle&#x2019;s eyes.<br><br> Danielle didn&#x2019;t wipe them, for fear of disturbing her makeup. Having spent half an hour putting on her face in front of the grainy mirror of Moira and John&#x2019;s bathroom, ogling her imperfections and applying vigorous remedial spackle&#x2014;beneath which her weary, olive-shaped eyes were pouched by bluish bags, the curves of her nostrils oddly red, and her high forehead peeling&#x2014;she had no intention of revealing to strangers the disintegration beneath her paint.<br><br> &#x201c;Come in, darlings, come in.&#x201d; Lucy moved behind them and herded the trio toward the party. The Leveretts&#x2019; living room was painted a deep purple&#x2014;aubergine, in local parlance&#x2014;and its windows were draped with velvet. From the ceiling hung a brutal wrought iron chandelier, like something salvaged from a medieval castle. Three men loitered by the bay window, talking to one another while staring out at the street, their glasses of red wine luminous in the reflected evening light. A long, plump, pillowed sofa stretched the length of one wall, and upon it four women were disposed like odalisques in a harem. Two occupied opposite ends of the divan, their legs tucked under, their extended arms caressing the cushions, while between them one rested her head upon another&#x2019;s lap, and smiling, eyes closed, whispered to the ceiling while her friend stroked her abundant hair. The whole effect was, for Danielle, faintly cloudy, as if she had walked into someone else&#x2019;s dream. She kept feeling this, in Sydney, so far from home: she couldn&#x2019;t quite say it wasn&#x2019;t real, but it certainly wasn&#x2019;t her reality.<br><br> &#x201c;Rog? Rog, more wine!&#x201d; Lucy called to the innards of the house, then turned again to her guests, a proprietorial arm on Danielle&#x2019;s bicep. &#x201c;Red or white? He&#x2019;s probably even got pink, if you&#x2019;re after it. Can&#x2019;t bear it myself&#x2014;so California.&#x201d; She grinned, and from her crows&#x2019; feet, Danielle knew she was forty, or almost.<br><br> Two men bearing bottles emerged from the candlelit gloom of the dining room, both slender, both at first glance slightly fey. Danielle took the imposing one in front, in a pressed lavender shirt and with, above hooded eyes, a high, smooth Nabokovian brow, to be her host. She extended a hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Danielle.&#x201d; His fingers were elegant, and his palm, when it pressed hers, was cool.<br><br> &#x201c;Are you now?&#x201d; he said.<br><br> The other man, at least a decade older, slightly snaggletoothed and goateed, spoke from behind his shoulder. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Roger,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Good to see you. Don&#x2019;t mind Ludo, he&#x2019;s playing hard to get.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Ludovic Seeley,&#x201d; Lucy offered. &#x201c;Danielle&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Minkoff.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Moira and John&#x2019;s friend.

He was&#x2014;she could feel it rather than see it, because his hooded eyes did not so much as flicker&#x2014;looking her up and down. She hoped that her makeup was properly mixed in, that no clump of powder had gathered dustily upon her chin or cheek.<br><br> The moment of recognition was, for Danielle, instantaneous. Here, of all places, in this peculiar and irrelevant enclave, she had spotted a familiar. She wondered if he, too, experienced it: the knowledge that this mattered. Ludovic Seeley: she did not know who he was, and yet she felt she knew him, or had been waiting for him. It was not merely his physical presence, the long, feline slope of him, a quality at once loose and controlled, as if he played with the illusion of looseness. Nor was it the timbre of his voice, deep and yet not particularly resonant, its Australian inflection so slight as to be almost British. It was, she decided, something in his face: he knew. Although what he knew she could not have said. There were the eyes, a surprising deep and gold-flecked gray, their lines slightly downturned in an expression both mournful and amused, and the particular small furrow that cut into his right cheek when he smiled even slightly. His ears, pinned close to his head, lent him a tidy aspect; his dark hair, so closely shaven as to allow the blue of his scalp to shine through, emphasized both his irony and his restraint. His skin was pale, almost as pale as Danielle&#x2019;s own, and his nose a fine, sharp stretch of cartilage. His face, so distinctive, struck her as that of a nineteenth-century portrait, a Sargent perhaps, an embodiment of sardonic wisdom and society, of aristocratic refinement. And yet in the fall of his shirt, the line of his torso, the graceful but not unmanly movement of his slender fingers (and yes, discreetly, but definitely there, he had hair on the backs of his hands&#x2014;she held to it, as a point of attraction: men ought not to be hairless), he was distinctly of the present. What he knew, perhaps, was what he wanted.<br><br> &#x201c;Come on, darling.&#x201d; Lucy took her by the elbow. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s introduce you to the rest of the gang.&#x201d;<br> This, dinner at the Leveretts&#x2019;, was Danielle&#x2019;s last evening in Sydney before heading home. In the morning, she would board the plane and sleep, sleep her way back to yesterday, or by tomorrow, to today, in New York. She&#x2019;d been away a week, researching a possible television program, with the help of her friend Moira. It wouldn&#x2019;t be filmed for months, if it were filmed at all, a program about the relationship between the Aborigines and their government, the formal apologies and amends of recent years. The idea was to explore the possibility of reparations to African Americans&#x2014;a high-profile professor was publishing a book about it&#x2014;through the Australian prism. It wasn&#x2019;t clear even to Danielle whether this could fly. Could an American audience care less about the Aborigines? Were the situations even comparable? The week had been filled with meetings and bluster, the zealous singing exchanges of her business, the pretense of certainty where in fact there was none at all. Moira firmly believed it could be done, that it should be done; but Danielle was not convinced.<br><br> Sydney was a long way from home. For a week, in her pleasant waft of alienation, Danielle had indulged the fantasy of another possible life&#x2014;Moira, after all, had left New York for Sydney only two years before&#x2014;and with it, another future. She rarely considered a life elsewhere; the way, she supposed, with faint incredulity, most people never considered a life in New York. From her bedroom in her friends&#x2019; lacy tin-roofed row house at the end of a shady street in Balmain, Danielle could see the water. Not the great sweep of the harbor, with its arcing bridge, nor the ruffled seagull&#x2019;s wings of the opera house, but a placid stretch of blue beyond the park below, rippled by the wake of occasional ferries and winking in the early evening sunlight.<br><br> Early autumn in Sydney, it was still bitter at home. Small, brightly colored birds clustered in the jacaranda trees, trilling their joyous disharmonies. In earliest morning, she had glimpsed, against a dawn-dappled shrub in the backyard, an enormous dew-soaked spiderweb, its intricacies sparkling, and poised, at its edge, an enormous furry spider. Nature was in the city, here. It was another world. She had imagined watching her 747 soar away without her, a new life beginning.<br><br> But not really. She was a New Yorker. There was, for Danielle Minkoff, only New York. Her work was there, her friends were there&#x2014;even her remote acquaintances from college at Brown ten years ago were there&#x2014;and she had made her home in the cacophonous, cozy comfort of the Village. From her studio in its bleached-brick high-rise at Sixth Avenue and Twelfth Street, she surveyed lower Manhattan like a captain at the prow of her ship. Beleaguered and poor though she sometimes felt, or craving an interruption in the sea of asphalt and iron, a silence in the tide of chatter, she couldn&#x2019;t imagine giving it up. Sometimes she joked to her mother&#x2014;raised, as she herself had been, in Columbus, Ohio, and now a resident of Florida&#x2014;that they&#x2019;d have to carry her out feet first. There was no place like New York. And Australia, in comparison, was, well, Oz.<br><br> This last supper in Sydney was a purely social event. Where the Leveretts lived seemed like an area in which one or two ungentrified Aboriginal people might still linger, gray-haired and bleary, outside the pub at the end of the road: people who, pint in hand, hadn&#x2019;t accepted the government&#x2019;s apology and moved on. Or perhaps not, perhaps Danielle was merely imagining the area, its residents, as they had once been: for a second glance at the BMWs and Audis lining the curb suggested that the new Sydney (like the new New York) had already, and eagerly, edged its way in.<br><br> Moira was friendly with Lucy Leverett, who owned a small but influential gallery down at The Rocks that specialized in Aboriginal art.

This goth-girl is obsessed with vampires and when a new family moves into the old town mansion, she is convinced that the son, Alexander, is a vampire. The story swirls around and through sibling rivalry, peer relationships, friendships, and love. Raven is a feisty protagonist with a quick wit and a real sense of self. She defends herself and her friends, often besting her peers with humor and a quick tongue. As her connection with Alexander deepens, she comes to understand her family better. It is through his shadowy character that readers are kept off balance. Schreiber weaves a tale that is more about acceptance and friendship than about vampire behavior and culture, and sustains a tone that draws readers to the characters rather than to horrific plot developments that would keep them reading. There is far less intensity than in Annette Curtis Klause's Silver Kiss (Laurel-Leaf, 1992) and less moodiness than that found in Amelia Atwater-Rhodes's Midnight Predator (2002) and Shattered Mirror (2001, both Delacorte). While the ending isn't tied up in a neat and pretty bow, it fits the style and tone. All in all, a good read for those who want a vampire love story without the gore.<br><i>Molly S.

As these collected essays amply prove, he is also our most intelligent and bracingly heretical writer on affairs involving not only Palestinians but also the Arab and Muslim worlds and their tortuous relations with the West.<br><br>In The Politics of Dispossession Said traces his people's struggle for statehood through twenty-five years of exile, from the PLO's bloody 1970 exile from Jordan through the debacle of the Gulf War and the ambiguous 1994 peace accord with Israel. As frank as he is about his personal involvement in that struggle, Said is equally unsparing in his demolition of Arab icons and American shibboleths. Stylish, impassioned, and informed by a magisterial knowledge of history and literature, The Politics of Dispossession is a masterly synthesis of scholarship and polemic that has the power to redefine the debate over the Middle East.</p><p>&#34;As this fascinating collection of essays confirms, no other liberation movement has had such a passionate, coherent, and objective voice as that given by Edward Said to the Palestinian people. Especially at this time of alleged transition in Israeli-Palestinian relations, Said&#39;s extraordinary moral imagination, political range, and cultural awareness provide a unique perspective. Anyone who claims concern with the past, present, and future fate of the Palestinian struggle needs to read and ponder Said&#39;s brilliantly sustained assessments.&#34;--Richard Falk, on The Politics of Dispossession"The most eloquent and visible voice of the Palestinian struggle in America.... [Said's] combination of flamboyant style and erudite radicalism, honesty and advocacy... makes The Politics of Dispossession necessary and informative for anyone interested in the complexities of the Palestinian question." -- San Francisco Chronicle<p>"This book should be read by anyone who wants to get beyond the shallow stereotypes that bedevil American thinking on the Middle East." -- Robert Hughes</p></p><h2>Wild Iris</h2><p><p>This collection of stunningly beautiful poems encompasses the natural, human, and spiritual realms, and is bound together by the universal themes of time and mortality. With clarity and sureness of craft, Gluck's poetry questions, explores, and finally celebrates the ordeal of being alive.</p></p><p>In an earlier set of poems, <b>The Garden</b>, Gluck retold the myth of Eden; in this sequence it is clear that paradise has been lost, and the poet, Eve-like, struggles to make sense of her place in the universe. For this old and still post-modern theme, Gluck bravely takes the risk of adopting a highly symbolic structure. She uses the conceit of parallel discourses between the flowers of a garden and the gardener (the poet), and between the gardener/poet and an unnamed god. The reader shares the poet's human predicament of being caught between these material and spiritual worlds, each lush and musical, drawing inspiration from both: from the flowers, a hymn to communality; from the god, a universal view of human suffering. The collection was awarded the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for poetry.Louise Gl�ck won the Pulitzer Prize for <em>The Wild Iris</em> in 1993.

Adam&#x2019;s sister, Meghan, and her lover, Will a convicted if unrepentant literary forger struggle to come to terms with the seemingly incomprehensible murder. But when Will begins receiving threatening handwritten letters, seemingly penned by long-dead authors, but really from someone who knows secrets about Adam&#x2019;s death and Will&#x2019;s past, he understands his own life is also on the line and attempts to forge a new beginning for himself and Meg. In <i>The Forgers</i>, Morrow reveals the passion that drives collectors to the razor-sharp edge of morality, brilliantly confronting the hubris and mortal danger of rewriting history with a fraudulent pen.</p><p><b>Bradford Morrow</b> is the author of seven novels and a short story collection. He is the founding editor of <i>Conjunctions</i> and has contributed to many anthologies and journals. A Bard Center Fellow and professor of literature at Bard College, he lives in New York City.<b>Bradford Morrow's <i>The Forgers</i> is a dark literary thriller set inside the world of rare books. The incomparable Karen Russell is a big fan of <i>The Forgers</i> and caught up with Morrow to talk to him about his forthcoming book.</b> <br> <br>KAREN RUSSELL: <i>The Forgers</i> is a totally <i>sui generis</i> existential thriller that introduced me to the world of rare book collecting, a world where I know you have serious street cred. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about how the idea to write <i>The Forgers</i> came to you? <br> <br>BRADFORD MORROW: <i>The Forgers</i> opens with a simple, disturbing, and to me compelling sentence, �They never found his hands.&#x201d; My editor, Otto Penzler, had asked if I would write a story for a series of bibliomysteries he publishes, and once I&#x2019;d settled on exploring the rarefied, high-stakes world of literary forgeries, I thought to myself, What would a ruthless forger most want to deprive a rival of having? Pens, nibs, inks, antique papers, subterranean connections in the rare book world? No, his hands, of course. So I began with that single image and all the narrative possibilities and challenges it offered. The rare book community, a collective of brilliant eccentrics among whom murderers don&#x2019;t generally mingle, is one I have been a part of for my whole adult life�first as a dealer, later as a collector�so most of my research was already done by the time I wrote that sentence and those that came after. <br> <br>My experience of writing <i>The Forgers</i> was one of extraordinary, unstoppable momentum�the story very quickly matured into a novella and the novella soon burst into a novel. And while, yes, it is a literary thriller, it is also a heartrending (at least to me) love story�love between two people, as well as a love of antiquarian books that, for some, crosses ethical borders into a place of bibliomania, of psychopathy. <br> <br>KAREN RUSSELL: This novel is Morrow magic at its best�I&#x2019;m thinking of the awake-with-a-flashlight feeling I had reading <i>The Diviner&#x2019;s Tale,</i> a novel that explores the quest for truth through the character of a female dowser, and the gothic spawn you&#x2019;ve gathered in your story collection, <i>The Uninnocent,</i> which, like <i>The Forgers,</i> is always honest about the best and worst parts of our natures. But <i>The Forgers</i> also feels like new ground to me. The lyricism of your prose, its humor and its unbelievably beautiful insights into human relationships and human nature, seem to challenge narrow definitions of what a �thriller&#x201d; can do. I confess that I&#x2019;m never sure how genre lines get drawn, and your book seems to me like a glorious hybrid creature, a genre pegosaurus, your own Morrow-mutation. Were you consciously setting out to rattle the cage bars of genre? <br> <br>BRADFORD MORROW: I love great genre writing, but talking genre can sometimes be a tricky business, in part because certain tropes over literary generations have become codified, and wherever there&#x2019;s a code, there are some out there who would enforce the code, others who are strict practitioners of the code, and so on. That said, many writers I admire have embraced the worlds of genre, imagining and inventing wonderful books that often push beyond traditional dictates. And readers are a far more resilient, edgy, engaged group of literary explorers than some give them credit for being. I love working with genre, playing with expectations, so long as I can write the narratives I&#x2019;m driven to write. If anything I do challenges narrow definitions, why then, that must be a good thing, I have to believe. <br> <br>KAREN RUSSELL: As far as love stories go, this is a terrifically original one. I was riveted by the tension between the narrator&#x2019;s private life as a forger and his public one with Meghan, the way his desires seem absolutely incompatible. �Do what you love,&#x201d; as you tell us, is an adage that can underwrite all kinds of unspeakable activities; and loving someone might require forfeiting a beloved activity that structures one&#x2019;s identity. How does this narrator&#x2019;s secret life as a forger impinge on his aboveground relationship? <br> <br>BRADFORD MORROW: While our narrator operates in a world deeply cast in shadows and secrets�he only mentions his own name once, and grudgingly in passing at that�his love for Meghan is unquestionable. To my mind, his private identities as a man who loves creating literary forgeries and a man who loves Meghan Diehl, incompatible as they may be, are equally powerful. Though his technique and literary historical knowledge as a forger are so exceptional that on occasion he feels he&#x2019;s created work that is, to borrow a line from U2, �even better than the real thing,&#x201d; it is very telling that he never gives Meghan, who runs an East Village used bookshop and loves books too, any forgeries. <br> <br>KAREN RUSSELL: As the editor of the in-every-sense-fabulous journal <i>Conjunctions,</i> you&#x2019;ve helped me and countless authors to firm up the �reality&#x201d; of their imaginary worlds. From your books, I know you to be an expert deceiver, and one proof of this is that I feel as if your books are a stranger&#x2019;s memories that I am importing into my own body. When you are working on your own forgeries (stories and novels), how do you vet for yourself when something feels emotionally true, even in a superficially outlandish or wild tale? And how can it be that we can all sense truth in art, even as it everywhere announces itself as imaginary, false? <br> <br>BRADFORD MORROW: Truth is a pretty holy tabernacle of a concept, but all art, no matter how original and even unprecedented it is, constitutes a kind of forgery in that �forgery&#x201d; is tantamount to �making.&#x201d; One <i>forges</i> ahead. One can just as easily form, shape, produce, forge something that&#x2019;s a true contribution not just to the arts but the world of wrought iron, for instance. Literary practitioners of the imaginary must create language that provides a gateway to a kind of separate reality, one that is both fictional and authentic at the same time, contradictory as that might seem. I used to worry about writing something emotionally true, but now I focus on language, trusting that the language I craft will articulate an experience of truth that my readers will share. <br> <br>KAREN RUSSELL: How pervasive is forgery in the rare book world, do you think? Do you have a favorite anecdote from your time as a dealer or a collector? <br> <br>BRADFORD MORROW: Every reputable rare book dealer who has been in business for any amount of time has encountered forgeries. Because reputation is paramount�these are smart, often scholarly people, some of them living encyclopedias, and proud of their legacies�most booksellers are intensely scrupulous about the manuscript materials and inscribed books they handle. This doesn&#x2019;t mean that fakes don&#x2019;t get into commerce. I can&#x2019;t say I have a favorite anecdote, but earlier this year at a rare book fair in New York, I saw an autographed copy of the first American edition of a Virginia Woolf book in which the signature was wrong, embarrassingly wrong. From an oversized �V&#x201d; on, the letters were inaccurately formed and far too large, the baseline was weirdly stepped up from her first name to the surname, the ink color was atypical, and so forth. This didn&#x2019;t stop the seller, who I assume didn&#x2019;t know better, from asking a very pretty penny for the piece. When I mentioned it to a dealer friend, an expert I trust who was also showing at the fair, he confirmed without having to look at it a second time that it was a forgery, and not a very sophisticated one at that. �Too bad,&#x201d; we agreed. �It would have been a pretty nice book.&#x201d; As for my own experiences, back when I was a rare book dealer in my twenties, I went out of my way to stay clear of any autograph material that seemed even slightly off, and as a collector I still do. Did any forgeries slip past me? Impossible to say impossible. <br> <br>You know, there are forgers from earlier centuries who are actually collected, because they were so sophisticated or brazen or both. Thomas Chatterton and William Ireland come to mind, as does Thomas Wise. Even the infamous in the arcane world of literary forgers have their fanciers, their biographers, their colorful histories. <br> <br>KAREN RUSSELL: <i>The Forgers</i> has epigraphs from Jorge Luis Borges and Arthur Conan Doyle�in terms of assembling a family tree for The Forgers, that sounds spot-on to me. What other influencers might you include, literary or otherwise, if you were tracing this novel&#x2019;s lineage? Who are some of your favorite liars, er, authors? <br> <br>BRADFORD MORROW: Friends who know my great admiration for William Gaddis may see hints of The Recognitions in The Forgers, since the former engages art forgery and the latter literary forgery, but if there was any influence of the one book on the other, it is lost on me, as I never consciously looked to Gaddis for any inspiration for this novel. When traveling in Ireland while writing the book�it was written quickly, by the way, in a matter of months, after some serious time stewing over it�I had a drink with John Banville, and had long been a fan of <i>The Book of Evidence,</i> which I see as a distant cousin to this novel, not plot-wise but tonally somehow. I did go back and reread most all of the Sherlock Holmes adventures as research for some of my forger&#x2019;s more inventive counterfeits, and have to feel that Doyle&#x2019;s pacing infected me, quick movements whereas I often love to linger. Nabokov&#x2019;s short novels I can cite as a direct influence. Orson Welles&#x2019; last major film, <i>F for Fake,</i> about the superlative art forger Elmyr de Hory, I watched at least three times. De Hory was in a league of his own�the shamelessness, the sheer genius, the scope of his ambition were altogether galvanizing to me as I plumbed this netherworld. Welles admired him too as a fellow �liar,&#x201d; a fellow bodhisattva in search of the believable sham. <br> <br>As for my favorite writers, they are many and various, and only some of them would cotton to the idea of being called liars or forgers. I&#x2019;ll let you guess who would and wouldn&#x2019;t. In no order other than their names come first to mind, I think of Beckett, Cather, Woolf, Angela Carter, Hardy, Nabokov, Gass, Thomas Bernhard. I&#x2019;m purposely leaving out the living and the Homers, Shakespeares, Donnes, and Swifts. But these are some whose work I go to for solace the same way others go to their Bible or whatever holy book they hold in high esteem. <br> <br>KAREN RUSSELL: I love the book, and was struck by your ability to channel some of the deep metaphysical preoccupations from your earlier books into a heart-in-your-throat page turner. How do you see <i>The Forgers</i> as connected to your other work? <br> <br>BRADFORD MORROW: That&#x2019;s an interesting question, a tougher one than it might seem. I can&#x2019;t truthfully say that I have some overarching philosophical system that informs my novels and stories. That said, certain themes have seemed to crop up in all eight of my books, including <i>The Forgers,</i> and they&#x2019;re also there in the novel I&#x2019;m finishing now, <i>The Prague Sonata.</i> Searching for an impossible place to call home in this world is one. The subjective nature of history and malleability of what&#x2019;s �real&#x201d; is another. I am fascinated by treacherous people who see themselves as spotless innocents�in other words, the kaleidoscopic range of self-deception available privately to all of us who ever breathed. Those are a few, anyway. I&#x2019;m sure there are many more abiding preoccupations that thread through my work, but Steven Millhauser recently wrote me that he&#x2019;s not much of a Steven Millhauser scholar, and I feel much the same way. Others will be able, if they&#x2019;re of a mind, to identify recurrent themes and ideas. My job is just to make each book as good as I can and hope it connects with sympathetic readers such as yourself. <br> <br>KAREN RUSSELL: How does the �act of</p><h2>Will There Really Be a Morning?</h2><p>The former Hollywood star recalls her tragic life, focusing on the years spent fighting for survival in a mental hospital</p><p></p><h2>Two Against Cape Horn</h2><p>Tells of two veteran sailors who set out to sail to a little-known archipelago and then around Cape Horn and succeeded only after their boat was wrecked on their first attempt</p><p></p><h2>Redburn: His First Voyage, Being the Sailor-Boy, Confessions and Reminiscences of the Son -of-a-Gentleman, In the Merchant Service (Penguin English Library)</h2><p>Wellington Redburn is a fifteen-year-old from the state of New York, with only one dream - to run away to sea.

Tolkien, begun in 1916-1917 when he was twenty-five years old and left incomplete several years later. It stands at the beginning of the entire conception of Middle-earth and Valinor, for the Lost Tales were the first form of the myths and legends that came to be called The Silmarillion. Embedded in English legend and English association, they are set in the narrative frame of a great westward voyage over the Ocean by a mariner named Eriel (or AElfwine) to Tol Eressea, the Lonely Isle, where Elves dwelt; from them he learned their true history, the Lost Tales of Elfinesse. In the Tales are found the earliest accounts and original ideas of Gods and Elves, Dwarves, Balrogs, and Orcs; of the Silmarils and the Two Trees of Valinor; of Nargothrond and Gondolin; of the geography and cosmography of the invented world.<br> The Book of Lost Tales will be published in two volumes; this first part contains the Tales of Valinor; and the second will include Beren and Luthien, Turin and the Dragon, and the only full narratives of the Necklace of the Dwarves and the Fall of Gondolin. Each tale is followed by a commentary in the form of a short essay; together with the texts of associated poems; and each volume contains extensive information on names and vocabulary in the earliest Elvish languages. Further books in this series are planned to extend the history of Middle-earth as it was refined and enlarged in later years, and will include the Long Lays of Beleriand, the Ambarkanta or Shape of the World, the Lhammas or Account of Tongues, annals, maps, and many other unpublished writings of J.R.R. Tolkien.</p><p>&#39;For the true devotee of Tolkien &#39;The Book of Lost Tales&#39; is a treasure trove to match the hoard of the dragon Smaug himself. The pure imaginative power of J.R.R. Tolkien shines through with a light just as dazzling as that of the Two Trees. The serious student of Tolkien will find much delight in this book, and it serves as an excellent example of the creative imagination at work.&#39; -Don Sakers, Baltimore SunTHE BOOK OF LOST TALES, I, stands at the beginning of the entire conception of Middle-earth and Valinor. Here is the whole, glorious history of Middle-earth that J.R.R.

People are often surprised to hear that the Vatican supports an astronomical observatory, yet the Vatican Observatory is one of the oldest astronomical institutes in the world, with its beginnings dating back to the reform of the calendar in 1582. Astronomy was one of the core subjects (along with arithmetic, geometry, and music) in the great medieval universities, taught by the Jesuits. Following the tradition of his order, Jesuit brother and working astronomer Guy Consolmagno considers himself to be a &#34;missionary of science;&#34; his mission: to undo the false assumption that the Church remains hostile to science. Blending memoir, science, history, and theology, Consolmagno takes us on a grand adventure. We revisit the infamous &#34;Galileo affair&#34; and see that it didn&#39;t unfold in quite the way we thought. We tour the Vatican&#39;s extensive meteorite collection and learn how astronomy progresses despite its dearth of tactile evidence. We get a rare glimpse into the world of working scientists and see how scientific discoveries are proposed and advanced (it hasn&#39;t changed much since Galileo&#39;s time). We learn the inside story of the &#34;Mars meteorite&#34;: how can we be sure it&#39;s really from Mars, and why can&#39;t scientists agree on whether or not it contains evidence of life? With Consolmagno as our guide we travel to Japan and see how geology informs planetary science; we go to Africa and witness mankind&#39;s innate curiosity about the heavens, even in the midst of desperate poverty; and we hunt for meteorites in Antartica. Most importantly, we see how science and religion can come together in one individual, and by extension, how they both are needed to answer the big questions. What would it mean to us if we did find life elsewhere in the universe? How did the world begin, and why does it follow natural laws? &#34;Science and Religion have an intimate tie,&#34; Brother Guy writes, &#34;Without faith in a Creator God, one who looks at His universe and declares it Good, how can you justify the belief that this universe is worth studying; indeed, that the universe even makes enough sense to be able to be studied?&#34;</p><p>Praise for <i>BROTHER ASTRONOMER</i>: <p> "Congenially conveying both meaty science and meaty theology, Consolmagno contributes vitally to the rapprochement of science and faith." - Booklist </p><p> "Consolmagno spills the contagious cheer of a man happily married to two loves - religion and science." - The Philadelphia Inquirer </p><p> "Deft writing" - Library Journal </p><p> "Memorable" - Natural History Magazine </p><p> <i>Brother Astronomer </i>is a wonderful contribution to the ongoing science-and-religion debate, from someone living in both worlds.

How did the world begin, and does it follow natural laws?</p>Brother Guy Consolmagno is an astronomer at the Vatican Observatory. He obtained his Ph.D. in Planetary Science from the University of Arizona and went on to teach at MIT until 1983, when he joined the Peace Corps. After two years of teaching university and high-school physics in Kenya, he returned to the U.S. He took vows as a Jesuit brother in 1991, and since then has studied philosophy and theology at Loyola University, Chicago, and physics at the University of Chicago. He has also spent several terms as a visiting scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center and as a visiting professor at Loyola College, Baltimore, and Loyola University, Chicago. His area of expertise is in the study of small solar-system objects, such as moons, asteroids, and meteors. At the Vatican, he serves as curator of one of the largest meteorite collections in the world. Consolmagno's writing has appeared in numerous journals and magazines including Sky &amp; Telescope, Leonardo Jesuits in Science, Ad Astra.</p><h2>Christmas in My Heart, A Fourth Treasury: Stories To Share The Spirit Of The Season</h2><p>The fourth edition of this holiday classic features more inspiring stories of sadness overcome and joy found during the Christmas season. Tour.</p><p>A String of Blue Beads<br>*<br>Fulton Oursler<br><br>One of the loveliest and most beloved of all Christmas short stories was penned by Fulton Oursler. Oursler's story reminds us that possessions without someone to share them with are hollow and meaningless. He also reminds us once again that one can't pay more than "all one has" for a gift.<br><br>(Charles) Fulton Oursler cast a giant shadow over his time (1893-1952). Besides editing Metropolitan, Liberty, Cosmopolitan, and Reader's Digest, he was a prolific writer of short stories, screenplays, and books, perhaps best known for his The Greatest Story Ever Told.<br><br>***<br><br>Pete Richards was the loneliest man in town on the day Jean Grace opened his door. You may have seen something in the newspapers about the incident at the time it happened, although neither his name nor hers was published, nor was the full story told as I tell it here.<br><br>Pete's shop had come down to him from his grandfather. The little front window was strewn with a disarray of old-fashioned things: bracelets and lockets worn in days before the Civil War, gold rings and silver boxes, images of jade and ivory, porcelain figurines.<br><br>On this winter's afternoon a child was standing there, her forehead against the glass, earnest and enormous eyes studying each discarded treasure, as if she were looking for something quite special. Finally she straightened up with a satisfied air and entered the store.<br><br>The shadowy interior of Pete Richards's establishment was even more cluttered than his show window. Shelves were stacked with jewel caskets, dueling pistols, clocks and lamps, and the floor was heaped with andirons and mandolins and things hard to find a name for.<br><br>Behind the counter stood Pete himself, a man not more than thirty but with hair already turning gray. There was a bleak air about him as he looked at the small customer who flattened her ungloved hands on the counter.<br><br>"Mister," she began, "would you please let me look at that string of blue beads in the window?"<br><br>Pete parted the draperies and lifted out a necklace. The turquoise stones gleamed brightly against the pallor of his palm as he spread the ornament before her.<br><br>"They're just perfect," said the child entirely to herself. "Will you wrap them up pretty for me, please?"<br><br>Pete studied her with a stony air. "Are you buying these for someone?"<br><br>"They're for my big sister. She takes care of me. You see, this will be the first Christmas since Mother died. I've been looking for the most wonderful Christmas present for my sister."<br><br>"How much money do you have?" asked Pete warily.<br><br>She had been busily untying the knots in a handkerchief and now she poured out a handful of pennies on the counter.<br><br>"I emptied my bank," she explained simply.<br><br>Pete Richards looked at her thoughtfully. Then he carefully drew back the necklace. The price tag was visible to him but not to her. How could he tell her? The trusting look of her blue eyes smote him like the pain of an old wound.<br><br>"Just a minute," he said, and turned toward the back of the store. Over his shoulder he called, "What's your name?" He was very busy about something.<br><br>"Jean Grace."<br><br>When Pete returned to where Jean Grace waited, a package lay in his hand, wrapped in scarlet paper and tied with a bow of green ribbon. "There you are," he said shortly. "Don't lose it on the way home."<br><br>She smiled happily at him over her shoulder as she ran out the door. Through the window he watched her go, while desolation flooded his thoughts. Something about Jean Grace and her string of beads had stirred him to the depths of a grief that would not stay buried. The child's hair was wheat yellow, her eyes sea blue, and once upon a time, not long before, Pete had been in love with a girl with hair of that same yellow and with eyes just as blue. And the turquoise necklace was to have been hers.<br><br>But there had come a rainy night-a truck skidding on a slippery road-and the life was crushed out of his dream.<br><br>Since then Pete Richards had lived too much with his grief in solitude. He was politely attentive to customers, but after business hours his world seemed irrevocably empty. He was trying to forget in a self-pitying haze that deepened day by day.<br><br>The blue eyes of Jean Grace jolted him into acute remembrance of what he had lost. The pain of it made him recoil from the exuberance of holiday shoppers. During the next ten days trade was brisk; chattering women swarmed in, fingering trinkets, trying to bargain. When the last customer had gone, late on Christmas Eve, he sighed with relief. It was over for another year. But for Pete Richards the night was not quite over.<br><br>The door opened and a young woman hurried in. With an inexplicable start, he realized that she looked familiar, yet he could not remember when or where he had seen her before. Her hair was golden yellow and her large eyes were blue. Without speaking, she drew from her purse a package loosely unwrapped in its red paper, a bow of green ribbon with it. Presently, the string of blue beads lay gleaming again before him.<br><br>"Did this come from your shop?" she asked.<br><br>Pete raised his eyes to hers and answered softly, "Yes, it did."<br><br>"Are the stones real?"<br><br>"Yes. Not the finest quality-but real."<br><br>"Can you remember who it was you sold them to?"<br><br>"She was a small girl. Her name was Jean. She bought them for her older sister's Christmas present."<br><br>"How much are they worth?"<br><br>"The price," he told her solemnly, "is always a confidential matter between the seller and the customer."<br><br>"But Jean has never had more than a few pennies of spending money. How could she pay for them?"<br><br>Pete was folding the gay paper back into its creases, rewrapping the little package just as neatly as before.<br><br>"She paid the biggest price anyone can ever pay," he said. "She gave all she had."<br><br>There was a silence then that filled the little curio shop. He saw the faraway steeple; a bell began ringing. The sound of the distant chiming, the little package lying on the counter, the question in the eyes of the girl, and the strange feeling of renewal struggling unreasonably in the heart of the man-all had come to be because of the love of a child.<br><br>"But why did you do it?"<br><br>He held out the gift in his hand.<br><br>"It's already Christmas morning," he said. "And it's my misfortune that I have no one to give anything to. Will you let me see you home and wish you a Merry Christmas at your door?"<br><br>And so, to the sound of many bells and in the midst of happy people, Pete Richards and a girl whose name he had yet to hear, walked out into the beginning of the great day that brings hope into the world for us all.</p><h2>The Shell Seekers</h2><p>Artist&#39;s daughter Penelope Keeling can look back on a full and varied life: a Bohemian childhood in London and Cornwall, an unhappy wartime marriage, and the one man she truly loved. She has brought up three children - and learned to accept them as they are. Yet she is far too energetic and independent to settle sweetly into pensioned-off old-age. And when she discovers that her most treasured possession, her father&#39;s painting, The Shell Seekers, is now worth a small fortune, it is Penelope who must make the decisions that will determine whether her family can continue to survive as a family, or be split apart.</p><p>"Beautifully done...

In an open window, a hideous blind nun perpetually gazing...watching. A body, burned beyond recognition. Then two more murders...strangely connected. And the discoverer, a beautiful young woman, raped. Her innocent child exposed to horror. Her husband, furious, relentlessly set on revenge. A cool, calculating, laughing priest intent on saving more lives from the destruction. And so it begins...powerful, satanic, terrifying...a time you will never forget.</p><p>Jeffrey Konvitz was born in New York City, but after graduating from Cornell University and Columbia Law School, he headed to Los Angeles, where he lives and works as an entertainment finance attorney, producer (The Sentinel and Spy Hard, among others) and novelist. His first published novel (Simon and Schuster and Ballantine) was The Sentinel, which rose to Number 2 on the New York Times Mass Market Best Seller List. The Sentinel sequel, The Guardian, was also a bestseller along with his next book, Monster. He is now at work on the third book in The Sentinel Trilogy, currently untitled, while The Sentinel and The Guardian are being mounted for e-book sales. <br><br>This year, his newly-written historical novel, The Circus of Satan, will be published. It is a story of murder and revenge, set during the rise of organized crime in America from 1900 to 1912 when the Irish Mob ruled all major American cities, only to be taken down by its own hubris and the rise of the Jewish and Italian Mobs into labor racketeering and, then, bootlegging. Filled with real events and real heroes and villains, who rampaged from New York's Bowery through to Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City and Boston, it is the story of epic, transformative times and two violent men, who meet on a descent into blood and Hell.<br><br>The author spends most of his spare time on tennis courts, on skis, on basketball courts, and in poker tournaments. The rest of his spare time is spent seeking the perfect word, the perfect sentence, the perfect phrase and the perfect characterization, a most challenging endeavor."This is no tale for realists or the weak of stomach, but readers who appreciate a bit of gore, bizarre Satanic doings and a plot with more turns than a spiral staircase will revel in Konvitz's well-written thriller."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Publishers Weekly (1979)<br><br><em>Publisher's Weekly #14 National Bestseller</em></i></p><h2>The Beginner&#39;s Guide to Vegetable Gardening: Everything You Need to Know (FFA)</h2><p><p>&nbsp;</p>If you want to harvest produce from your own backyard garden, <i>The Beginner's Guide to Vegetable Gardening</i> has everything you need to know about growing healthy veggies, herbs, and popular fruits such as strawberries and raspberries.

An extraordinary work of imagination, these blueprints of TV homes that are as familiar to us as our neighbor's den and backyard give us a fascinating "real life" view that the camera angles never offered.<br><br> From Ward and June Cleaver's house to Rob and Laura Petrie's apartment to Mary Richards's Minneapolis bachelorette apartment to the Jetson's "house" in the clouds, each home is lovingly recreated with painstaking precision in the fine blue lines of architectural blueprints.</p><p>This book of architectural blueprints is a loving, if obsessive, tribute to the minutiae of televised domestic life. Author Mark Bennett's excrutiatingly detailed plans span 25 years of television history, from Tiger's doghouse on <i>The Brady Bunch</i> to <i>The Addams Family</i>'s entire manor, including Lurch's harpsichord, Gomez's train set, and Uncle Fester's laboratory. Also included are <i>Laverne and Shirley</i>'s bachelorette pad, <i>The Jetson</i>'s space unit, and Archie and Edith Bunker's Queens row house. Incredibly, all the plans are drawn to be architecturally feasible; that is, one could actually build from them. To accomplish this feat, the author often had to imagine rooms and areas not shown on the television programs, but only referred to, like Ward Cleaver's den or Ralph and Alice Kramden's bedroom. Included are detailed renderings not only of the characters' homes, but their entire towns, such as the whole of Mayberry and a complete layout of Gilligan's Island.At 4222 Clinton Way in Los Angeles, a split-level contemporary features three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a maid's room. Perfect for the six children of Mike and Carol Brady.<p> At 322 Maple, in the friendly town of Mayberry, is a comfortable two-story wood and shingle house. This is the residence of local sheriff Andy Taylor, his son Opie, and Aunt Bee. Large trees grace the front yard.</p><p> At 211 Pine Street, in Mayfield, lives the Beaver, with his brother Wally and his parents Ward and June. Ward's book-lined den and the spacious living room are just right for Wally's teen parties.</p><p> These are the homes where our favorite television families lived - the Brady kids; Beaver and Wally; Opie; Lucy and Ricky; Richie Cunningham; Ralph and Alice Kramden; Fred and Wilma Flintstone. These characters were a part of our day-to-day lives, and they live on in our memories and on cable television.</p><p> In TV SETS, Mark Bennett has lovingly recreated the blueprints for forty sitcom homes. Working first with small sketches on envelopes and table napkins - and in the days before videocassette recorders - Bennett gathered information on each home before making a formal drawing. The bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, doghouses, and, in some cases, such as Mayberry R.F.D., the entire town, have been carefully drawn, all down to the last fascinating detail.

No. No, he mustn&#x2019;t turn and stare. Needing some other focus for his gaze, he fixed his eyes instead on Quarry&#x2019;s scar.<br><br>&#x201c;A glass with you, sir?&#x201d; Scarcely waiting for the club&#x2019;s steward to provide for his companion, Harry Quarry drained his cup of claret, then held it out for more. &#x201c;And another, perhaps, in honor of your return from frozen exile?&#x201d; Quarry grinned broadly, the scar pulling down the corner of his eye in a lewd wink as he did so, and lifted up his glass again.<br><br>Lord John tilted his own cup in acceptance of the salute, but barely tasted the contents. With an effort, he kept his eyes on Quarry&#x2019;s face, willing himself not to turn and stare, not to gawk after the flash of fire in the corridor that had caught his eye.<br><br>Quarry&#x2019;s scar had faded; tightened and shrunk to a thin white slash, its nature made plain only by its position, angled hard across the ruddy cheek. It might otherwise have lost itself among the lines of hard living, but instead remained visible, the badge of honor that its owner so plainly considered it.<br><br>&#x201c;You are exceeding kind to note my return, sir,&#x201d; Grey said. His heart hammered in his ears, muffling Quarry&#x2019;s words&#x2014;no great loss to conversation.<br><br>It is not, his sensible mind pointed out, it cannot be. Yet sense had nothing to do with the riot of his sensibilities, that surge of feeling that seized him by nape and buttocks, as though it would pluck him up and turn him forcibly to go in pursuit of the red-haired man he had so briefly glimpsed.<br><br>Quarry&#x2019;s elbow nudged him rudely, a not-unwelcome recall to present circumstances.<br><br>&#x201c;. . . among the ladies, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I say your return has been noted elsewhere, too. My sister-in-law bid me send her regard and discover your present lodgings. Do you stay with the regiment?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I am at present at my mother&#x2019;s house, in Jermyn Street.&#x201d; Finding his cup still full, Grey raised it and drank deep. The Beefsteak&#x2019;s claret was of excellent vintage, but he scarcely noticed its bouquet. There were voices in the hall outside, raised in altercation.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah. I&#x2019;ll inform her, then; expect an invitation by the morn- ing post. Lucinda has her eye upon you for a cousin of hers, I daresay&#x2014;she has a flock of poor but well-favored female relations, whom she means to shepherd to good marriages.&#x201d; Quarry&#x2019;s teeth showed briefly. &#x201c;Be warned.&#x201d;<br><br>Grey nodded politely. He was accustomed to such overtures. The youngest of four brothers, he had no hopes of a title, but the family name was ancient and honorable, his person and countenance not without appeal&#x2014;and he had no need of an heiress, his own means being ample.<br><br>The door flung open, sending such a draft across the room as made the fire in the hearth roar up like the flames of Hades, scattering sparks across the Turkey carpet. Grey gave thanks for the burst of heat; it gave excuse for the color that he felt suffuse his cheeks.<br><br>Nothing like. Of course he is nothing like. Who could be? And yet the emotion that filled his breast was as much disappointment as relief.<br><br>The man was tall, yes, but not strikingly so. Slight of build, almost delicate. And young, younger than Grey, he judged. But the hair&#x2014;yes, the hair was very like.<br><br>Lord John Grey.&#x201d; Quarry had intercepted the young man, a hand on his sleeve, turning him for introduction. &#x201c;Allow me to acquaint you with my cousin by marriage, Mr. Robert Gerald.&#x201d;<br><br>Mr. Gerald nodded shortly, then seemed to take hold of himself. Suppressing whatever it was that had caused the blood to rise under his fair skin, he bowed, then fixed his gaze on Grey in cordial acknowledgment.<br><br>&#x201c;Your servant, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And yours.&#x201d; Not copper, not carrot; a deep red, almost rufous, with glints and streaks of cinnabar and gold. The eyes were not blue&#x2014;thank God!&#x2014;but rather a soft and luminous brown.<br><br>Grey&#x2019;s mouth had gone dry. To his relief, Quarry offered refreshment, and upon Gerald&#x2019;s agreement, snapped his fingers for the steward and steered the three of them to an armchaired corner, where the haze of tobacco smoke hung like a sheltering curtain over the less-convivial members of the Beefsteak.<br><br>&#x201c;Who was that I heard in the corridor?&#x201d; Quarry demanded, as soon as they were settled. &#x201c;Bubb-Dodington, surely? The man&#x2019;s a voice like a costermonger.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2014;he&#x2014;yes, it was.&#x201d; Mr. Gerald&#x2019;s pale skin, not quite recovered from its earlier excitement, bloomed afresh, to Quarry&#x2019;s evident amusement.<br><br>&#x201c;Oho! And what perfidious proposal has he made you, young Bob?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing. He&#x2014;an invitation I did not wish to accept, that is all. Must you shout so loudly, Harry?&#x201d; It was chilly at this end of the room, but Grey thought he could warm his hands at the fire of Gerald&#x2019;s smooth cheeks.<br><br>Quarry snorted with amusement, looking around at the nearby chairs.<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s to hear? Old Cotterill&#x2019;s deaf as a post, and the General&#x2019;s half dead. And why do you care in any case, if the matter&#x2019;s so innocent as you suggest?&#x201d; Quarry&#x2019;s eyes swiveled to bear on his cousin by marriage, suddenly intelligent and penetrating.<br><br>&#x201c;I did not say it was innocent,&#x201d; Gerald replied dryly, regaining his composure. &#x201c;I said I declined to accept it. And that, Harry, is all you will hear of it, so desist this piercing glare you turn upon me. It may work on your subalterns, but not on me.&#x201d;<br><br>Grey laughed, and after a moment, Quarry joined in. He clapped Gerald on the shoulder, eyes twinkling.<br><br>&#x201c;My cousin is the soul of discretion, Lord John. But that&#x2019;s as it should be, eh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have the honor to serve as junior secretary to the prime minister,&#x201d; Gerald explained, seeing incomprehension on Grey&#x2019;s features. &#x201c;While the secrets of government are dull indeed, at least by Harry&#x2019;s standards&#x201d;&#x2014;he shot his cousin a malicious grin&#x2014;&#x201c;they are not mine to share.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, well, of no interest to Lord John in any case,&#x201d; Quarry said philosophically, tossing back his third glass of aged claret with a disrespectful haste more suited to porter. Grey saw the senior steward close his eyes in quiet horror at the act of desecration, and smiled to himself&#x2014;or so he thought, until he caught Mr. Gerald&#x2019;s soft brown eyes upon him, a matching smile of complicity upon his lips.<br><br>&#x201c;Such things are of little interest to anyone save those most intimately concerned,&#x201d; Gerald said, still smiling at Grey. &#x201c;The fiercest battles fought are those where very little lies at stake, you know. But what interests you, Lord John, if politics does not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not lack of interest,&#x201d; Grey responded, holding Robert Gerald&#x2019;s eyes boldly with his. No, not lack of interest at all. &#x201c;Ignorance, rather. I have been absent from London for some time; in fact, I have quite lost . . . touch.&#x201d;<br><br>Without intent, one hand closed upon his glass, the thumb drawing slowly upward, stroking the smooth, cool surface as though it were another&#x2019;s flesh. Hastily, he set the glass down, seeing as he did so the flash of blue from the sapphire ring he wore. It might have been a lighthouse beacon, he reflected wryly, warning of rough seas ahead.<br><br>And yet the conversation sailed smoothly on, despite Quarry&#x2019;s jocular inquisitions regarding Grey&#x2019;s most recent posting in the wilds of Scotland and his speculations as to his brother officer&#x2019;s future prospects. As the former was terra prohibita and the latter terra incognita, Grey had little to say in response, and the talk moved on to other things: horses, dogs, regimental gossip, and other such comfortable masculine fare.<br><br>Yet now and again, Grey felt the brown eyes rest on him, with an expression of speculation that both modesty and caution forbade him to interpret. It was with no sense of surprise, though, that upon departure from the club, he found himself alone in the vestibule with Gerald, Quarry having been detained by an acquaintance met in passing.<br><br>&#x201c;I impose intolerably, sir,&#x201d; Gerald said, moving close enough to keep his low-voiced words from the ears of the servant who kept the door. &#x201c;I would ask your favor, though, if it be not entirely unwelcome?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am completely at your command, I do assure you,&#x201d; Grey said, feeling the warmth of claret in his blood succeeded by a rush of deeper heat.<br><br>&#x201c;I wish&#x2014;that is, I am in some doubt regarding a circumstance of which I have become aware. Since you are so recently come to London&#x2014;that is, you have the advantage of perspective, which I must necessarily lack by reason of familiarity. There is no one . . .&#x201d; He fumbled for words, then turned eyes grown suddenly and deeply unhappy on Lord John. &#x201c;I can confide in no one!&#x201d; he said, in a sudden, passionate whisper. He gripped Lord John&#x2019;s arm, with surprising strength. &#x201c;It may be nothing, nothing at all. But I must have help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You shall have it, if it be in my power to give.&#x201d; Grey&#x2019;s fingers touched the hand that grasped his arm; Gerald&#x2019;s fingers were cold. Quarry&#x2019;s voice echoed down the corridor behind them, loud with joviality.<br><br>&#x201c;The &#x2019;Change, near the Arcade,&#x201d; Gerald said rapidly. &#x201c;Tonight, just after full dark.&#x201d; The grip on Grey&#x2019;s arm was gone, and Gerald vanished, the soft fall of his hair vivid against his blue cloak.<br><br>Grey&#x2019;s afternoon was spent in necessary e...</p><h2>Midnight for Charlie Bone</h2><p>A magical fantasy that is fast-paced and easy-to-read. Charlie Bone has a special gift- he can hear people in photographs talking. The fabulous powers of the Red King were passed down through his descendants, after turning up quite unexpectedly, in someone who had no idea where they came from. This is what happened to Charlie Bone, and to some of the children he met behind the grim, gray walls of Bloor&#39;s Academy. Charlie Bone has discovered an unusual gift-he can hear people in photographs talking! His scheming aunts decide to send him to Bloor Academy, a school for genius&#39;s where he uses his gifts to discover the truth despite all the dangers that lie ahead.</p><p><b>JENNY NIMMO</b> is an award-winning author who lives with her painter husband in a converted mill in Wales. Ms. Nimmo's books include <i>The Snow Spider</i>, winner of the Smarties Prize, and <i>Griffin's Castle</i>, short-listed for the Smarties Prize, the Carnegie Medal, the Whitbread Award, and the W.H. Smith's Mind Boggling Award. <i>The Owl Tree</i> won the Smarties Gold Prize Award for six-to-eight-year-olds.Grade 4-6-Young readers are getting to be quite conversant with the characteristics of British boarding schools, especially those for the magically inclined. Jenny Nimmo's novel (Scholastic/Orchard, 2003) has postulated a set of characters, the Endowed, who exhibit very odd magical abilities that seem to have no purpose or usefulness at all and appear randomly in descendants of the nearly-mythical Red King. There are two branches of these descendants: the perplexed but essentially good people who have no idea why they can make light bulbs explode or hear voices coming from photographs, and the evil ones who seem to be part of a very complex and as yet unrevealed sinister scheme. This unusual take on magical abilities makes for a distinctly different set of circumstances and plot. Bloor's Academy which schools both Endowed and artistically gifted unendowed children has a much darker feel to it than Hogwart's but is still perfectly recognizable with its prefects, dining hall, dormitories, and so on. Charlie Bone, who discovers his Endowment at age 11 and has grown up in enigmatic family circumstances which he is only just beginning to figure out, makes many friends among the Endowed as well as the musicians, artists, and actors who people the school. This first tale from a projected series benefits from a reading by Simon Russell Beale which is rife with atmosphere and mystery. His voice, rich with nuance and emotion, brings to life each person and situation, and embellishes the story with a sense of drama and suspense fully appropriate to the tone of the writing. Charlie unravels one mystery of a missing Endowed girl in the course of setting the stage for dramatic future adventures. Not as complex at least not yet as the Harry Potter books, the promise exists for a continued completely fresh angle on the magic story. Many hints are provided of depths to be plumbed in future entries in the series, and a few plot lines in particular are already obvious. Listeners are going to be well rewarded in this audiobook, and they'll be anticipating future episodes.<br><i>Jane P.

A strong writer in the "newcomers to watch" category back when she published <i>China Trade</i>, her first novel featuring New York sleuths Bill Smith and Lydia Chin, she is now a real player on the scene, poised for bestsellerdom.<p> The story she tells here takes us out of the gritty five boroughs and onto the New Jersey Turnpike, where Smith's sister Helen lives, in a place called Warrenstown. But did we know Bill even had a sister? Over the course of seven books and several short stories, even Lydia Chin, his partner and best friend, hasn't known this. So what gives?</p><p> We learn about Helen Smith Russell through a totally unexpected phone call from a Midtown South police detective, answered by Bill in his Tribeca loft. It seems the cops have his nephew in custody, a 15-year-old runaway who is the son of the sister with whom Bill has not been in touch for 25 years.</p><p> Two mysteries are being set up here, but before Rozan is finished, more than even these two will have been followed to their tragic conclusions. Each of the sinister puzzles seems to circle back around to Gary, the frightened nephew, and also to that seemingly straight-arrow suburbia he's fleeing.</p><p> Warrenstown, New Jersey, is also where Scott, Gary's dad, grew up. The trouble is that Helen's husband is part of the problem, not the solution. And while Bill, Lydia, and young Gary are trying to expose to fresh air the secrets from the past that keep festering (and killing), the villains (those with a deep interest in preserving reputations, as well as the legendary local football team, at all costs) want nothing more than to stop them.</p><p> It may be unusual territory, but S.J. Rozan can now be listed alongside Harlan Coben and Janet Evanovich as writers helping to give New Jersey the right kind of bad name. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p><p>"To read S.J.

You&#x2019;re not alone: an estimated one billion of us across the globe suffer chronic pain every day. And what Dr. Mitchell Yass has found over his 20-year career is that many of us suffer needlessly. While the current medical model for treating pain isn&#x2019;t helping, there is hope. The Pain Cure Rx presents an alternative model of treatment&#x2014;the Yass Method&#x2014;that can resolve pain quickly and effectively without surgery or medication.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the medical community today, most chronic pain is attributed to a structural problem, such as a herniated disc, a meniscal tear, or arthritis. But Dr. Yass has found that in about 90 percent of cases, the cause is actually a muscular weakness or imbalance&#x2014;a condition that&#x2019;s easy to treat on your own. The Yass Method, developed through his work with more than 14,000 patients, focuses on finding the true source of the pain and then using simple exercises to find lifelong relief.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Yass looks at the most common areas where people experience pain; lays out simple tests that examine things like range of motion, walking patterns, and posture; and teaches you to use this information, rather than invalid diagnostic tests, to determine whether your pain is muscular or structural. If it is structural, you can choose surgery, knowing that the outcome will likely be good. But if the pain is muscular, you can use the easy, step-by-step exercises and routines Dr. Yass offers to get the pain resolution you&#x2019;re searching for.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the people Dr. Yass has treated came to him as a last resort before surgery or as a follow-up after surgery that didn&#x2019;t resolve their pain. Many of them had been told that they would have to manage their pain with drugs for the rest of their lives, or, worse, that there was nothing left to try; they would simply have to live with the pain. This revolutionary book shows that, in most cases, this simply isn&#x2019;t true&#x2014;and empowers you to create a pain-free life.</p><p><b>Dr. Mitchell Yass</b> has spent the past 20 years developing his method of diagnosing and treating the cause, not the symptom, of pain and believes that this is the future of pain relief. He is currently treating patients in Florida utilizing his unique method; he is also the author of Overpower Pain and was host of the radio show Stop the Pain! I Want My Life Back. He has written articles for various publications, including Advance for Physical Therapists and PT Assistants, Bottom Line Health, and Cure-Back-Pain.org, and he has been featured on numerous radio shows.<br> Website: www.mitchellyass.com&#x201c;If you are suffering with chronic pain, this book is for you.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014; Deepak Chopra, M.D., New York Times best-selling author of The Future of God<br><br> &#x201c;Every once in a while a book comes along that will completely transform a field&#x2014;this is that book for pain.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014; Haylie Pomroy, New York Times best-selling author of The Fast Metabolism Diet<br><br> &#x201c;After working with Dr. Yass for so many years as an expert for many articles in our newsletters, I am so happy to see that he is now providing a complete guide to understanding his method of diagnosing and treating chronic pain. I have personally shared Dr. Yass&#x2019;s approach with countless people, cautioning them away from surgery and towards the right type of exercise. None of them ended up requiring surgery!

The book begins with his childhood family life, to finding his guru, to becoming a monk and establishing his teachings of Kriya Yoga meditation. The book continues in 1920 when Yogananda accepts an invitation to speak in a religious congress in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. He then travels across America lecturing and establishing his teachings in Los Angeles, California. In 1935 he returns to India for a yearlong visit. When he returns to America, he continues to establish his teachings, including writing this book.</p><p>Autobiography of a Yogi is not an ordinary book. It is a spiritual treasure. To read its message of hope to all truthseekers, is to begin a great adventure. This is a verbatim reprinting of the original, 1946 edition of "Autobiography of a Yogi". Although subsequent printings, reflecting revisions made after the author's death in 1952, have sold over a million copies and have been translated into more than 19 languages, the few thousand of the original have long since disappeared into the hands of collectors. Now, with this reprint, the 1946 edition is again available, with all its inherent power, just as the great master of yoga first presented it. <p>Editions past the third have been prepared since the author's passing in 1952. In 1953, Self-Realization Fellowship, acquired the rights to "Autobiography of a Yogi" from Philosophical Library; it has been the publisher of all subsequent editions, until this original reprint put out by Crystal Clarity, Publishers.

Evans-Wentz, M.A., D.Litt., D.Sc. <p>Jesus College, Oxford; Author of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa, Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, etc. </p><p>The value of Yogananda's Autobiography is greatly enhanced by the fact that it is one of the few books in English about the wise men of India which has been written, not by a journalist or foreigner, but by one of their own race and training--in short, a book about yogis by a yogi. As an eyewitness recountal of the extraordinary lives and powers of modern Hindu saints, the book has importance both timely and timeless. To its illustrious author, whom I have had the pleasure of knowing both in India and America, may every reader render due appreciation and gratitude. His unusual life-document is certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu mind and heart, and of the spiritual wealth of India, ever to be published in the West. </p><p>It has been my privilege to have met one of the sages whose life-history is herein narrated-Sri Yukteswar Giri. A likeness of the venerable saint appeared as part of the frontispiece of my Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines*(1). It was at Puri, in Orissa, on the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar. He was then the head of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and was chiefly occupied in the spiritual training of a group of youthful disciples. He expressed keen interest in the welfare of the people of the United States and of all the Americas, and of England, too, and questioned me concerning the distant activities, particularly those in California, of his chief disciple, Paramhansa Yogananda, whom he dearly loved, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as his emissary to the West. </p><p>Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence, and worthy of the veneration which his followers spontaneously accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own community or not, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic. He had chosen as his place of earthly abode the holy city of Puri, whither multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of every province of India, come daily on pilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath, "Lord of the World." It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed his mortal eyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transitory state of being and passed on, knowing that his incarnation had been carried to a triumphant completion. </p><p>I am glad, indeed, to be able to record this testimony to the high character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar. Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly and in tranquillity to that ideal life which Paramhansa Yogananda, his disciple, has now described for the ages W. Y.

Some of the more conspicuous changes in Western spiritual discourse and practice have been the tremendous influence of Eastern thought, the increased role of women, ecological concerns, and the connection between cosmology and the sacred. Vardey touches on all those perspectives in this passionately researched and creatively organized anthology that follows the path of a spiritual journey. Vardey's own cogent commentary and the eloquent excerpts she has chosen resonate together to make a sort of music of the soul. On one page spread, for example, Vardey quotes Thomas Merton, physicist Fritjof Capra, Alan Watts, and Martin Buber. She has included poems, brilliant letters from an imprisoned Vaclav Havel, and striking passages by C. G. Jung, Thich Nhat Hanh, Aldous Huxley, J. Krishnamurti, Marion Woodman, Martin Luther King Jr., and Mary A. Bateson, to name just a few of the more than 100 distinguished and inspired contributors. This major work is a genuine treasury of spiritual thought and expression. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>The History of Middle-Earth: Index</h2><p>Complete integrated indices of History of Middle-earth volumes to complement new series.

Two hip-pocket frogs, less than an inch long, guard their eggs until tiny tadpoles emerge and wriggle up the male's hind legs into hidden pockets. Once the eggs hatch, the female's work is done, but for the next 30 days, the male must hunt for food and keep his skin wet while eluding predators. By the time the froglets emerge from his pockets, he has reached a creek bank where they can find the moisture they need for their continued survival.

Fittingly, in his analysis of primary materials and historical accounts Porch is able to verify that many legends of the Legion contain more than a grain of truth. From its establishment in 1831 it was intended as a catch basin for the malcontents and desperate men of Europe, many of whom were then swarming into France as political refugees. Assigned originally to the French conquest of Algeria, it began to establish a reputation for itself during a subsequent disastrous campaign in Spain in 1835. In the course of its long career, the Legion has served commendably in Russia and Mexico, in the Franco-Prussian and both World Wars, and in Indochina, where its brave but futile struggle to retain Dien Bien Phu against the Viet Minh in 1954 signaled an end to French colonialism in the region. It was to North Algeria, however, that it was most often returned, and in 1961 Algeria almost became its undoing when prevailing Legion sentiments against Algerian independence led to a crisis with the de Gaulle government and a quickly repressed coup d'&#x201a;tat. As a result of this colorful history, the Legion emerges here with a life of its own, complemented by assessments of the sociopolitical situation. Stimulating reading for adventurers and serious students alike--an informative, lively view of a unique military presence in modern times.

Many, many millennia ago, the Inhibitors seeded the universe with machines designed to detect intelligent life - and then to suppress it. But after hundreds of millions of years, the machines started to fail and intelligent cultures started to emerge. Then Dr Dan Sylveste and the crew of Infinity discovered what had happened to the long-vanished Amarantin race ...and awakened the Inhibitors. On Yellowstone, where no one is quite who they appear, the Inquisitor and the planet&#39;s Most Wanted War Criminal are watching as the Inhibitors turn a small group of planets into raw materials. Whatever they are building with those materials is not going to be good for Humanity. Once again, Al Reynolds has produced a stunning, universe-spanning space opera of mind-blowing proportions. Big in size, big in concepts, REDEMPTION ARK will leave you gasping at its audacity and breathless at its conclusion. This is British SF at its absolute best.</p><p>Alastair Reynolds was born in Barry, South Wales, in 1966. He studied at Newcastle and St Andrews Universities and has a Ph.D. in astronomy. Since 1991 he has lived in the Netherlands, near Leiden, where he works as an astrophysicist for the European Space Agency. The first three books in his loosely linked series, Revelation Space, nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke and the British Science Fiction awards, Chasm City, winner of the British Science Fiction Award, and Redemprion Ark, are all Gollancz bestsellers.This is Alastair Reynold's third book with us and the interest in Al has definitely increased. He is definitely becoming a name and authority on the SF circle and will soon pose a major threat to Peter F Hamilton and Iain Banks. Interviews: An extensive interview with THE ZONE website.

Reprint.</p><p>Veteran true-crime readers are familiar with the cold murder committed by a sociopath, versus the hot murder committed in a moment of rage or jealousy. But what to make of someone who murders her spouse simply to keep him from finding out that she borrowed a few thousand from the bank? This story of a Durham, North Carolina, woman who appeared to be a devoted mother, meticulous housekeeper, loving wife, and church leader, is even more puzzling when we learn that what's beneath is not all that shocking: she lies, she's promiscuous, she's a perfectionist, and she spends too much money. The mystery is the motive in this tale of a murderer, <i>both</i> of whose husbands died, in bed, of "accidents with guns." Jerry Bledsoe has a crisp, unemotional prose style. His expertly paced courtroom cliffhangers kept this reviewer up reading long past midnight. <i>Before He Wakes</i> was a finalist for the 1995 Edgar Award in Fact Crime.<p><b>Jerry Bledsoe </b>is the author of the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Bitter Blood</i> and others.

SANSOM REWRITES HISTORY IN A THRILLING NOVEL THAT DARES TO IMAGINE BRITAIN UNDER THE THUMB OF NAZI GERMANY.<br><br>1952. Twelve years have passed since Churchill lost to the appeasers and Britain surrendered to Nazi Germany. The global economy strains against the weight of the long German war against Russia still raging in the east. The British people find themselves under increasingly authoritarian rule--the press, radio, and television tightly controlled, the British Jews facing ever greater constraints. <br><br>But Churchill's Resistance soldiers on. As defiance grows, whispers circulate of a secret that could forever alter the balance of the global struggle. The keeper of that secret? Scientist Frank Muncaster, who languishes in a Birmingham mental hospital.<br><br>Civil Servant David Fitzgerald, a spy for the Resistance and University friend of Frank's, is given the mission to rescue Frank and get him out of the country. Hard on his heels is Gestapo agent Gunther Hoth, a brilliant, implacable hunter of men, who soon has Frank and David's innocent wife, Sarah, directly in his sights.<br><br>C.J.

Now, in his first alternative history epic, Sansom doesn't just recreate the past--he reinvents it.

The variation in tone across the tales is handled exceptionally well, as we see Miles mourn and get a better look at his relationship with Illyan. The stories include Miles's first outing as a detective, in which he's faced with a case of infanticide in the mutant-phobic hill country; his largest rescue mission ever; and the most distressed damsel for whom he ever played the knight.<i>Author's Note</i>:<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Vorkosigan Saga Reading Order Debate: The Chef Recommends</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Many pixels have been expended debating the 'best' order in which to read what have come to be known as the Vorkosigan Books, the Vorkosiverse, the Miles books, and other names, since I neglected to supply the series with a label myself.&nbsp; The debate now wrestles with some fourteen or so volumes and counting, and mainly revolves around publication order versus internal-chronological order.&nbsp; I favor internal chronological, with a few caveats.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have always resisted numbering my volumes; partly because, in the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because if I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately with <i>Captain Vorpatril's Alliance</i>) it would upwhack the numbering system.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the books and stories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was always my intention to write each book as a stand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with that book that's in your hand <i>right now</i>, don't put it back on the shelf!&nbsp; While still somewhat true, as the series developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that were richer for each other.&nbsp; I will list the sub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Shards of Honor</i> and <i>Barrayar.</i>&nbsp; The first two books in the series proper, they detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar.&nbsp; <i>Shards</i> was my very first novel ever; <i>Barrayar</i> was actually my eighth, but continues the tale the next day after the end of <i>Shards</i>.&nbsp; For readers who want to be sure of beginning at the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> and <i>The Vor Game</i> (with, perhaps, the novella "The Mountains of Mourning" tucked in between.)&nbsp; <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> introduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the first book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second how he fixed his mistakes from the first round. Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things one can best discover for oneself), <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> makes another good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist.<br> &nbsp;<br> After that: <i>Brothers in Arms</i> should be read before <i>Mirror Dance</i>, and both, ideally, before <i>Memory.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Komarr</i> makes another good alternate entry point for the series, picking up Miles's second career at its start.&nbsp; It should be read before <i>A Civil Campaign</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i>, a collection of three of the five currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure sampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit themselves to length.&nbsp; (But it may make more sense if read after <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>.)&nbsp; Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its title story, "The Borders of Infinity".<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i> takes place 200 years earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with the main body of the series.&nbsp; Most readers recommend picking up this story later. It should likely be read before <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, however, which revisits the "quaddies", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's time.<br> &nbsp;<br> The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear in italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words and 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i><br> <i>Shards of Honor</i><br> <i>Barrayar</i><br> <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i><br> "The Mountains of Mourning"<br> "Weatherman"<br> <i>The Vor Game</i><br> <i>Cetaganda</i><br> <i>Ethan of Athos</i><br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i><br> "Labyrinth"<br> "The Borders of Infinity" <br> <i>Brothers in Arms</i><br> <i>Mirror Dance</i><br> <i>Memory</i><br> <i>Komarr</i><br> <i>A Civil Campaign</i><br> "Winterfair Gifts"<br> <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i><br> <i>Captain Vorpatril's </i><i>Alliance</i><i>&nbsp; </i>(upcoming in late 2012)<br> <i>CryoBurn</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Caveats:<br> &nbsp;<br> The novella "Weatherman" is an out-take from the beginning of the novel <i>The Vor Game</i>.&nbsp; If you already have <i>The Vor Game</i>, you likely don't need this.<br> &nbsp;<br> The original 'novel' <i>Borders of Infinity</i> was a fix-up collection containing the three novellas "The Mountains of Mourning", "Labyrinth", and "The Borders of Infinity", together with a frame story to tie the pieces together. Again, beware duplication.&nbsp; The frame story does not stand alone, and generally is of interest only to completists.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Fantasy Novels</b><br> &nbsp;<br> My fantasy novels are a bit easier to order.&nbsp; Easiest of all is <i>The Spirit Ring</i>, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed books that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series.&nbsp; Next easiest are the four volumes of <i>The Sharing Knife</i>--in order, <i>Beguilement</i>, <i>Legacy</i>, <i>Passage</i>, and <i>Horizon</i>--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one continuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks.<br> &nbsp;<br> What have come to be called the Chalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written, like the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and can in theory be read in any order.&nbsp; (The third book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely connected first two.)&nbsp; Some readers think the world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in publication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the first (but not the third.)&nbsp; In any case, the publication order is:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Curse of Chalion</i><br> <i>Paladin of Souls</i><br> <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Happy reading!<br> &nbsp;<br> -- Lois McMaster Bujold.</p><h2>Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin</h2><p>* In the middle of Europe, in the middle of the twentieth century, the Nazi and Soviet regimes murdered fourteen million people in a zone of death between Berlin and Moscow. * These were the bloodlands - today&#39;s Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, western Russia and the eastern Baltic coast. In a twelve-year period - 1933 to 1945 - as a result of deliberate polices unrelated to combat, an average of more than a million civilians were murdered annually. At the end of the Second World War the bloodlands fell behind the iron curtain, leaving their history in darkness. * In this revelatory book Timothy Snyder offers a groundbreaking investigation of Europe&#39;s killing fields and a sustained explanation of the motives and methods of both Hitler and Stalin. He anchors the history of Hitler&#39;s Holocaust and Stalin&#39;s Terror in their time and place and provides a fresh account of the relationship between the two regimes. Using scholarly literature and primary sources in all relevant languages, Snyder pays special attention to the testimony of the victims: the letters home, the notes flung from trains, the diaries found on corpses. * Brilliantly researched, profoundly humane, authoritative and original, Bloodlands re-examines the greatest tragedy in European history and forces us to rethink our past.</p><p>Timothy Snyder received his doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1997. He has held fellowships in Paris and Vienna, and an Academy Scholarship at Harvard. He has written and edited a number of critically-acclaimed and prize-winning books about twentieth-century European history, including The Reconstruction of Nations, Sketches from a Secret War and The Red Prince. He is Professor of History at Yale University.If there is an explanation for the political killing perpetrated in eastern Europe in the 1930s and 1940s, historian Snyder roots it in agriculture. Stalin wanted to collectivize farmers; Hitler wanted to eliminate them so Germans could colonize the land. The dictators wielded frightening power to advance such fantasies toward reality, and the despots toted up about 14 million corpses between them, so stupefying a figure that Snyder sets himself three goals here: to break down the number into the various actions of murder that comprise it, from liquidation of the kulaks to the final solution; to restore humanity to the victims via surviving testimony to their fates; and to deny Hitler and Stalin any historical justification for their policies, which at the time had legions of supporters and have some even today. Such scope may render Snyder&#x2019;s project too imposing to casual readers, but it would engage those exposed to the period&#x2019;s chronology and major interpretive issues, such as the extent to which the Nazi and Soviet systems may be compared. Solid and judicious scholarship for large WWII collections. --Gilbert Taylor</p><h2>What Color Is Your Parachute?

Yes, but before you can start making decisions about careers, you really need to think out the life you want and what work will help you get that life. What purpose do you want your life to serve? What purpose does work serve in your life?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book can help you answer those questions.&nbsp; By reading this book and doing the exercises, you will learn how to describe the life you want as a young adult (or beyond), what you want in a dream job, and how to use that information to help you identify the training, education, and jobs that will help you get the experience and skills you need to qualify for your dream job.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work you will enjoy grows out of your values&#x2014;that is, what is important to you. This book has been written to help you learn, step by step, what values are important to you and what kind of a life you want. That way, you&#x2019;ll be able to describe what makes up a job that is good for you and how to go about getting hired to do work you want to do.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know you don&#x2019;t really want to read a book. You&#x2019;re asking, &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t there some quicker method of learning what kind of career is right for me?&#x201d; It would be so much easier if there were a foolproof method for helping each teen discover their perfect job. It would be lovely if there were a &#x201c;sorting hat&#x201d; for careers. Put it on your head and instead of saying which Hogwarts house you belong to, it would tell you what job was perfect for you. But there really isn&#x2019;t one perfect job that, if you&#x2019;re lucky enough to guess right, you&#x2019;ll have forever. What&#x2019;s perfect for you will change with age, experience, and the economy.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Knights of the Round Table, you have a quest. Except, instead of finding the holy grail, your quest is to find your place in the world, what kind of a life you want, and how you are going to earn a living in ways you can enjoy. Most teens want their adult years to be fun and fulfilling&#x2014;which is hard to achieve if you hate your job.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As fascinating as you are, it can take a while to get to know yourself and to pull information about you and the world of work together. In studying young adult success in transitioning from school to work, it&#x2019;s surprising to find that it takes about ten years to get from no clue, to a detailed plan, to well-employed. So if you hope to spend your quarterlife birthday celebrating your personal and professional success, plan on beginning your career exploration about age fifteen.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why fifteen? There are lots of reasons, but the most compelling is that you&#x2019;ve still got plenty of time to become aware of dozens of careers, check them out, toss some out, find some more to explore, and eventually find several options that really interest you. In addition, planning ahead gives you time to take classes that will improve your employment skills or let you go deeper into subjects you like.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&#x2019;re just fifteen, you can skip the first four chapters (for now). Read them when you&#x2019;re seventeen or eighteen. Those chapters are for older teens with some work experience, and teach you how to find your favorite interests, skills, and goals to create a description of what you want in a job. We suggest you start reading this book at the end. Chapter 12 is about the life you want as a twentysomething, which is a good goal to start thinking about now!&nbsp; You might also want to check out How to Find What You Love to Do: Naming Your Interests (chapter 1, page 10) and the Party exercise (chapter 2, page 23) to get ideas about career fields to explore.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifteen is a good age to ask yourself the following question: &#x201c;Is it important to me to be able to choose and shape the life and work I do, or am I willing to take what&#x2019;s available?&#x201d; If you want to choose and shape your life, you&#x2019;ll have a great adventure. But first you&#x2019;ll have to learn some new skills for making decisions.&nbsp; This book will introduce you to those skills. Like learning any new set of skills, you&#x2019;ll get better at them the more you use them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If having the life you want or working at a particular job is your definition of the good life, we recommend that by the time you reach age seventeen you read this book&#x2014;and do the exercises&#x2014;from cover to cover. By your senior year (or before, if you&#x2019;re the plan-way-ahead type), you should have come up with well-researched strategies for achieving your work and personal goals.&nbsp; What&#x2019;s important is not the job you pick&#x2014;it&#x2019;s learning the process of how to pick one.&nbsp; After all, most adults have quite a few jobs before they find their dream job.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jobs are like clothing; you have to try on a lot of them before you begin to find your style and outfits that fit you well. And, like the world of fashion, the job market is constantly changing. Some jobs that were in &#x201c;fashion&#x201d; a decade ago may not even exist today. Jobs you&#x2019;ll love in your thirties and forties may not exist today. Many students pick a dream job and as they work toward it, they find jobs they like even better. No wonder you want to start this process now, in high school. It takes young people about a decade to wrestle with these issues, make some initial decisions, and find where they fit in the world of work. The sooner you start, the sooner you&#x2019;ll get the life you want.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Older than fifteen and you haven&#x2019;t done any career exploration or planning? Don&#x2019;t despair. Just read this book and catch up. Learning what you want and designing a career plan will help you no matter what your age.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#x2019;re delighted to have had a chance to update this book. The economy has changed, and so has the job market. Finding a job is tougher than ever&#x2014;according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, just 20 percent of last year&#x2019;s college grads have found full-time jobs. But if you know what fascinates you, and you continue to develop and revise your career plans, you&#x2019;ll be better prepared than other job applicants when the time comes to get hired! In addition, we wanted to offer you the very latest in ideas, tools, statistics, and resources that can help you discover the life you want and great jobs to fund that life. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Introduction<br></b><br>This book is about you&#x2014;and your future&#x2014;which is, of course, a very fascinating subject! We want to explore who you are, what&#x2019;s important to you, and what you like to do. Why? We believe life is meant to be lived to the fullest, and we want to give you the tools to create the kind of life you want. We want to help you discover what you&#x2019;d love to do with your life, especially work that you will love.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m only fourteen [or fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen],&#x201d; you say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m too young to be thinking about my life&#x2019;s work!&#x201d; We agree. We don&#x2019;t expect you to plan out your whole career in high school, or even in college. This book is to help you create your first career path. Your first career path is simply how you want to earn a living as a young adult when you leave school, at whatever level that is. The sooner you start thinking about your future, the more time you have to explore all your options.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think your teen years are a great time to be thinking about your life&#x2019;s work. For many, high school may be the only time you have enough time to check out all the jobs that match your interests. Although this can be done when you are living on your own, it&#x2019;s so much easier to do while your parents are paying your bills! As a young adult, you&#x2019;re beginning to discover what&#x2019;s important to you&#x2014;how you like to spend your time, who you like to be with, which classes interest you (and which ones don&#x2019;t). And most likely, you&#x2019;re becoming aware that some adults you know&#x2014;teachers, parents, coaches, and others&#x2014;really enjoy what they&#x2019;re doing, and others don&#x2019;t. We want to help you find work that you&#x2019;ll enjoy&#x2014;work that&#x2019;s fun, satisfying, and challenging, all rolled into one. <br><br><b>Who Should Read This Book?</b><br><br>Whether college-bound or work-bound after high school, this book is for you if any of the following describe you:<br>�&nbsp; You care about how you&#x2019;ll earn a living.<br>�&nbsp; You have career goals but may not know how to reach them.<br>�&nbsp; You want to find a college major that&#x2019;s right for you.<br>�&nbsp; You want to take as much control over your life as possible.<br>�&nbsp; You hope to become financially independent as soon as possible.<br>�&nbsp; You hope to find a fun job to finance your life while you figure out what you really want to do for work, what kind of a life you want to have and how you can get that life, and who, as a person, you really want to be.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, if you want work that you love, enjoy, or feel is the right fit for you, and if you&#x2019;re willing to spend some time learning about yourself and about the world of work, this book is for you. <br><br><b>Why Do I Need This Book?<br></b><br>Finding a job you&#x2019;ll love takes not only time and energy but also awareness of many kinds of careers, plus career-choice and job-search skills. Chances are, even if you feel like you&#x2019;re quite busy now, you have time and energy you can devote to increasing your awareness of what kind of work is good for you, and gaining skills that will help you find that kind of work. When we talked with young adults engaged in their own job hunt, they often told us that if they had only known how to use their time in school to make themselves more employable in the future, they would have made better use of that time.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both authors of this book have websites through which they hear from job hunters around the world. They often receive letters from people who say they have been surprised by how hard it has been to find a job, or how long it has taken them.Too many young people use techniques they&#x2019;ve heard mentioned over the years.&nbsp; Unfortunately, today&#x2019;s economy is too tricky to rely on hearsay techniques. Getting a challenging job that pays well and interests you isn&#x2019;t easy. Studying the effective job-search and career development techniques outlined in this book will greatly improve your chances of getting hired for jobs you really want.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want you to be prepared, not surprised. We want to help you to work smart, which means developing job-search savvy that will help you now and throughout your adult life. If you use your time now to do some planning for how you want to earn a living, you stand a good chance of achieving your career goals. Even if you&#x2019;re not sure what you want to do&#x2014;and you&#x2019;re not alone there (many adults feel that way too)&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll help you discover just what kind of job will be a good and satisfying one for you. You&#x2019;ll learn what you need to know about yourself and about the world of work so that you can make good choices about how you want to live and work.<br><br><b>Why Did We Write This Book?<br></b><br>We want you to find work that you love or build a life you love through work you enjoy. We want to give you the skills necessary to find out what it is you love to do, and to find a job where you can do just that.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our work, we meet thousands of adults who don&#x2019;t know how to find work they love. When they were in high school, very few of them learned effective job-search skills&#x2014;usually because classes in job-search skills weren&#x2019;t even offered. Even though adults are expected to work, few have been taught how to discover what they most wanted out of work and life, or what employers wanted and expected of them. Of those students planning on college, many don&#x2019;t receive guidance on selecting a major, even though finding the right major is an important step toward finding a great job.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want your life to be different. We want you to have both the skills and the knowledge necessary to find good and rewarding work throughout your life.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of work changes constantly. Some jobs disappear, while new ones appear; others change significantly because of scientific advances, new technology, or the needs and expectations of society. The strength or weakness of the economy also affects the number and types of jobs available. If you have solid job-search skills and know what you really want to do, you can thrive&#x2014;or, like a cat, always land on your feet&#x2014;even when the work world changes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you&#x2019;ve had a few part-time jobs already. Maybe you liked your work, maybe you didn&#x2019;t. More likely, you liked some parts of your work but not others. Those work experiences&#x2014;and all your life experiences&#x2014;are valuable because they can tell you important things about yourself and about the work you want to do.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you ready for an adventure? Great! That&#x2019;s what this book can offer you&#x2014;an adventure in discovering more about you and what&#x2019;s most important to you. So let&#x2019;s get started by looking at your life and discovering your answer to this question: How do I find work I will love?</p><h2>Gifts of deceit: Sun Myung Moon, Tongsun Park, and the Korean scandal</h2><p>Based on the 1978 report of the Frazer Committee, a Congressional Subcommittee on International Organizations.</p><p></p><h2>Trumps of Doom (Chronicles of Amber, No. 6)</h2><p>In the continuation of the Amber chronicles, Corwin, Prince of Amber, exiled to Earth because of an ancient feud with his brothers, must battle his way back to the perfect world of Amber, the center of reality</p><p></p><h2>The Bitterweed Path: A Rediscovered Novel (Chapel Hill Books)</h2><p>This long out-of-print and newly rediscovered novel tells the story of two boys growing up in the cotton country of Mississippi a generation after the Civil War. Originally published in 1950, the novel&#39;s unique contribution lies in its subtle engagement of homosexuality and cross-class love. In The Bitterweed Path, Thomas Hal Phillips vividly recreates rural Mississippi at the turn of the century. In elegant prose, he draws on the Old Testament story of David and Jonathan and writes of the friendship and love between two boys-one a sharecropper&#39;s son and the other the son of the landlord-and the complications that arise when the father of one of the boys falls in love with his son&#39;s friend. Part of a very small body of gay literature of the period, The Bitterweed Path does not sensationalize homosexual love but instead portrays sexuality as a continuum of human behavior. The result is a book that challenges many assumptions about gay representation in the first half of the twentieth century.</p><p>"[This book] is a delicate, sensitive work, written in a warm, quiet rhythm which creates and maintains a mood and an atmosphere proper to the story's locale and period. . . . Phillips has made the action of his story flow as effortlessly as time itself; he has brought [Southern rural] life during the early years of the century into the sort of believable reality which other Southern writers carefully avoid."--Thomas Sugrue, <i>New York Times Book Review</i>, September 10, 1950 <br>Originally published in 1950, The Bitterweed Path tells the story of friendship and love between two boys growing up in the cotton country of Mississippi a generation after the Civil War. A fine example of the southern literary tradition, the novel is also part of a very small body of gay literature of the period. As such, it challenges many assumptions about gay representation in the first half of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Vagabond (The Grail Quest, Book 2)</h2><p>The eagerly anticipated follow-up to the bestselling Harlequin, this is the second instalment in Bernard Cornwell&#39;s Grail Quest series. In Harlequin, Thomas of Hookton travelled to France as an archer and there discovered a shadowy destiny, which linked him to a family of heretical French lords who sought Christendom&#39;s greatest relic. Having survived the battle of Crecy, Thomas is sent back to England, charged with finding the Holy Grail. But Thomas is an archer and when a chance comes to fight against an army invading northern England he jumps at it. Plunged into the carnage of Neville&#39;s Cross, he is oblivious to other enemies who want to destroy him. He discovers too late that he is not the only person pursuing the grail, and that his rivals will do anything to thwart him. After hunting and wounding him, Thomas&#39;s enemies turn him into a fugitive. Fleeing England, he travels to Normandy, determined to rescue Will Skeat, his old commander from Harlequin. Finally Thomas leads his enemies back to Brittany, where he goes to discover an old love and where his pursuers at last trap their reluctant pilgrim. Vagabond is a vivid and realistic portrait of England at a time when the archer was king of Europe&#39;s battlefields.</p><p><i>Vagabond</i>, the second entry in Bernard Cornwell's Grail Quest series, has been eagerly anticipated by those who read the first book, and it doesn't disappoint. Thomas has managed to survive the battle of Cr�cy. Still nursing his wounds, he is dispatched by the king on a mission to look into the matter of his father's inheritance, which is obscurely connected to the Holy Grail. This most precious relic of the Christian faith is a much sought-after object, offering the power of total victory in war to its owner. But Thomas finds himself in the middle of a battle against an army invading the North of England, and other shadowy forces pursuing the grail are prepared to slaughter anyone who stands in their way. In the ruins of his birthplace, Thomas discovers more about his father, and a dangerous voyage to France brings him up against his cousin and arch-enemy, Count of Astarc Guy Vexville. The stage is set for a merciless showdown.<p> Thomas is a protagonist drawn quite as pithily as his much-loved predecessor, and the sheer verve of Cornwell's storytelling here is irresistible. We are plunged into a distant age: bloody, colourful and dangerous. Roll on, volume three! <i>--Barry Forshaw, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><p>In the eagerly anticipated sequel to <em>The Archer's Tale</em> in Bernard Cornwell's acclaimed Grail Quest series, a young archer sets out to avenge his family's honor on the battlefields of the Hundred Years' War and winds up on a quest for the Holy Grail.</p><p>1347 is a year of war and unrest. England's army is fighting in France, and the Scots are invading from the North. Thomas of Hookton, sent back to England to follow an ancient trail to the Holy Grail, becomes embroiled in the fighting at Durham. Here he meets a new and sinister enemy, a Dominican Inquisitor, who, like all of Europe, is searching for Christendom's most holy relic. It is not certain the grail even exists, but no one wants to let it fall into someone else's hands. And though Thomas may have an advantage in the search -- an old notebook left to him by his father seems to offer clues to the whereabouts of the relic -- his rivals, inspired by a fanatical religious fervor, have their own ways: the torture chamber of the Inquisition. Barely alive, Thomas is able to escape their clutches, but fate win not let him rest. He is thrust into one of the bloodiest fights of the Hundred Years' War, the Battle of La Roche-Derrien, and amid the flames, arrows, and butchery of that night, he faces his enemies once again.</p></p><h2>Jesus Incident</h2><p>Uncountable millenia in the future, the chaplain/psychiatrist aboard the Voidship &#34;Earthling&#34; grapples with a complex philosophical problem in order to stave off the imminent demise of his race</p><p><p><b>Frank Herbert</b> (1920-1986), winner of the Hugo and Nebula awards and a #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author, was born in Tacoma, Washington, and worked as a reporter and later as an editor for a number of West Coast newspapers before becoming a full-time writer. His first science fiction story was published in 1952, but he achieved fame more than ten years later with the publication of "Dune World" and "The Prophet of Dune" in <i>Analog</i>. The stories were amalgamated in the bestselling novel <i>Dune</i> in 1965.</p>&#39;&#39;This is a tremendously exciting, mysterious, and powerful novel.

Negative thinking is seen as a debilitating illness that will slowly kill your spirit -- and for some people lead to actual physical disease. Happily though, this is not a doom-filled book at all! The authors show how to: Eliminate The Negative -- spend less time thinking &#39;down&#39; and negative thoughts. / Accentuate The Positive -- spend more time focussing on the positive things in your life. / Latch On To The Affirmative -- enjoy each moment! Packed full of inspirational, funny, and moving quotes. This book was written in part specially for those who have been diagnosed with severe illness. Negative thinking drags you down -- whilst a truly positive approach will have a positive effect on your whole self -- thus promoting good physical health. Though this book is a terrific inspirational read for anyone looking to recover health, it&#39;s essentially a big book about positive thinking and is certainly not limited to an &#39;ill&#39; market!</p><p></p><h2>The Death of Luigi Trastulli and Other Stories: Form and Meaning in Oral History (Suny Series in Oral and Public History)</h2><p>Portelli offers a new and challenging approach to oral history, with an interdisciplinary and multicultural perspective. Examining cultural conflict and communication between social groups and classes in industrial societies, he identifies the way individuals strive to create memories in order to make sense of their lives, and evaluates the impact of the fieldwork experience on the consciousness of the researcher. By recovering the value of the story-telling experience, Portelli&#x2019;s work makes delightful reading for the specialist and non-specialist alike.</p><p><p>Alessandro Portelli is Professor of American Literature at the University of Rome &#x201c;La Sapienza.&#x201d;</p>&#x201c;The essays that Alessandro Portelli has produced on the meaning of oral history are incredibly insightful.

Was he mad, or was I idiotically incredulous? For--and it is this thing that haunts me--when I found them dead together in the vault, she had been buried five weeks. But the body that lay in John Hurst's arms, among the mouldering coffins of the Hursts of Hurstcote, was perfect and beautiful as when he first clasped her to his arms, a bride."<br> E. Nesbit's "The Hursts of Hurstcote" is only one of the many stories found in <em>The Oxford Book of Gothic Tales</em>, the first anthology of this spinetingling genre. Though Gothic fiction has generally been identified with Walpole's"Castle of Otranto" and the works of Ann Radcliffe, these thirty-seven selections compiled by Chris Baldick provide a unique look at the genre's development into its present-day forms. We see standard gothic elements of incest, murder, and greed in "The Poisoner of Montremos," a late eighteenth-century story by Richard Cumberland. We find in Poe's "The Fall of the House of Usher" the tale that set a new standard of decadence for Gothic stories. In Hawthorne's "Rappacini's Daughter," a young girl is raised on the very essence of poison. In Faulkner's "A Rose for Emily," a woman's death satisfies a neighborhood's curiosity with a bizarre discovery. In other tales, a ghost reveals his sin of parricide, madness drives a man to murder,and a young girl spends her lifetime locked in a single room. All these stories and more contain the common elements of the gothic tale: a warped sense of time, a claustrophobic setting, a link to archaic modes of thought, dynastic corruption, and the impression of a descent into disintegration. Yet they also reveal the progression of the genre from stories of feudal villains amid crumbling ruins to a greater level of sophistication in which writers brought the gothic tale out of its medieval setting, and placed it in the contemporary world.<br> Bringing together the work of such writers as Robert Louis Stevenson, Eudora Welty, Thomas Hardy, Edgar Allan Poe, William Faulkner, Isak Dinesen, Arthur Conan Doyle, Joyce Carol Oates, Jorge Luis Borges, Eudora Welty, Patrick McGrath, and Isabel Allende, <em>The Oxford Book of Gothic Tales</em> presents a wide array of the sinister and unsettling for all lovers of ghost stories, fantasy, and horror.</p><p><br><em>About the Editor</em>:<br> <strong>Chris Baldick</strong> is a Lecturer in English at the University of Lancaster. He is the author of <em>In Frankenstein's Shadow: Myth andMonstrosity in Nineteenth-Century Writing</em> (1987).<br>The fog-enshrouded castle, the crumbling family manor; old secrets unveiled, curses cast, chains clanking, fear and trembling; dread, decay, disintegration, death--each of these trademarks of the well-made Gothic tale is vividly represented in this comprehensive anthology. Informatively introduced and chronologically arranged, the 37 stories showcase the Gothic tradition from its late-18th-century inception up to the present. Included are genre classics from such illustrious practitioners as Poe, Hawthorne, Lovecraft and McGrath, as well as gems from literary masters like Faulkner, Welty, Oates and Borges, all of whom dabble(d) to fine effect in the form. Among the highlights are "The Parricide Punished," an anonymous entry from 1799 set in an enormous castle and narrated by a guest whose visit becomes a waking nightmare; Eden Glasgow's "Jordan's End," in which a long history of family madness gives rise to a most untimely death; F. M. Mayor's "Miss DeMannering of Asham," the story of two women on holiday who get more local color than they bargained for when they learn the shocking truth about DeMannering's dead infant; and especially Ray Russell's bizarre "Sardonicus," whose title character gives the kind of villainous performance that evokes Vincent Price in his horror-movie heyday. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Firekeeper&#39;s Son</h2><p>In Korea in the early 1800s, news from the countryside reached the king by means of signal fires. On one mountaintop after another, a fire was lit when all was well. If the king did not see a fire, that meant trouble, and he would send out his army. Linda Sue Park's first picture book for Clarion is about Sang-hee, son of the village firekeeper. When his father is unable to light the fire one night, young Sang-hee must take his place. Sang-hee knows how important it is for the fire to be lit-but he wishes that he could see soldiers . . . just once.<br> Mountains, firelight and shadow, and Sunhee's struggle with a hard choice are rendered in radiant paintings, which tell their own story of a turning point in a child's life. Afterword.</p><p><p><b>Linda Sue Park </b>is the author of bestseller <i>A Long Walk to Water&nbsp;</i>as well as the Newbery Medal book <i>A Single Shard</i>&nbsp;and many other acclaimed novels and picture books.&nbsp;She lives in Rochester, NY. www.lspark.com,Twitter: @LindaSuePark.</p><br><br>Julie Downing has written and/or illustrated over 30 picture books.

She lives in San Francisco, California. For more information visit www.juliedowning.com.PreSchool-Grade 3-Park's command of place, characterization, and language is as capable and compelling in this picture book as it is in her novels. Set in 19th-century Korea, this story centers around an actual bonfire signal system. Every night, when Sang-hee's father sees that the ocean is clear of enemies, he climbs the mountain to light his fire, setting in motion a chain reaction of blazes that eventually reaches the peak closest to the palace and assures the king that all is well in the land. When Father breaks his ankle, his son must ascend alone into the darkness with a bucket of burning coals. During a dramatic pause, he contemplates the consequences of inaction and his secret desire to see the king's soldiers. Lyrical prose and deftly realized watercolors and pastels conjure up the troops in a vision linked to the glowing coal clasped in the boy's tongs. In the next scene, a close-up of the last coal illuminates Sang-hee's eyes, his face a study of concentration. Upon the child's descent, his father shares the memory of his own youthful desires and his pride in his son's accomplishment. A sense of inherited mission pervades the conclusion as Sang-hee learns that he, too, is "part of the king's guard." Children will be intrigued by this early form of wireless communication, caught up in the riveting dilemma, and satisfied by the resolution.<br><i>Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It's a question facing millions today, as science reveals a Universe that's self-creating, as American culture departs from Christian social norms, and the idea of God begins to seem implausible at best and barbaric at worst. <br> &nbsp;<br> Mike McHargue understands the pain of unraveling belief. In <em>Finding God in the Waves</em>, Mike tells the story of how his Evangelical faith dissolved into atheism as he studied the Bible, a crisis that threatened his identity, his friendships, and even his marriage. Years later, Mike was standing on the shores of the Pacific Ocean when a bewildering, seemingly mystical moment motivated him to take another look. But this time, it wasn't theology or scripture that led him back to God&#x2014;it was science.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> In <em>Finding God in the Waves</em>, "Science Mike&#x201d; draws on his personal experience to tell the unlikely story of how science led him back to faith. Among other revelations, we learn what brain scans reveal about what happens when we pray; how fundamentalism affects the psyche; and how God is revealed not only in scripture, but in the night sky, in subatomic particles, and in us.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the faithful and skeptic alike, <em>Finding God in the Waves</em> is a winsome, lucid, page-turning read about belonging, life&#x2019;s biggest questions, and the hope of knowing God in an age of science.</p><p>Mike McHargue, also known as &#34;Science Mike,&#34; is a Christian turned atheist turned follower of Jesus who uses his story to help people know God in an age of science. Mike is the host and co-host of two podcasts--Ask Science Mike and The Liturgists Podcast--that have attracted a curious following among Christians, the spiritually interested, and the religiously unaffiliated.

I wore my hair in a bowl cut and had an odd appreciation for Hawaiian shirts. The shelves in my bedroom were full of computer magazines, spare parts from robots, and toys from science fiction movies arranged in scenes of battle.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s how deep my &#x201c;nerdery&#x201d; ran: When I was eight, I took apart a VCR and reassembled its parts in a lunch box. I put the lunch box in a backpack and then ran some cabling from the backpack to a roughly cylindrical mechanical assemblage that I had scavenged (OK, stolen) from my grandparents&#x2019; farm in rural North Florida. The end result was a homemade proton pack, which allowed me to start an unlicensed Ghostbusters franchise in my neighborhood. I convinced my friends to build packs of their own, and we would roam the streets of our neighborhood at night, catching ghosts. I had no idea how prophetic this would be, my fixation with a movie in which humans dominated the supernatural with science and technology. But that&#x2019;s a story for later.<br><br>For now, all you need to understand is that, in the 1980s, a passionate love for science, an overactive imagination, and a chubby physique were not exactly the recipe for popularity. I was a round peg (a very round one) for a too-�small square hole, and this made my grade-�school days a living hell.<br><br>My elementary school in Tallahassee, Florida, was like a John Hughes &#x201c;Brat Pack&#x201d; film gone horribly wrong. Ever since I could remember, an unofficial but strict hierarchy had dominated our social world. Everyone knew who our leaders were: a small collection of boys who were the funniest, the fastest runners, and the first picked when we played team sports. I both idolized and feared them.<br><br>The rest of the social pecking order was indecipherable to me. But I knew I was at the very bottom, the nerdiest of the nerds. Time spent in my company was damaging to anyone&#x2019;s reputation&#x2014;�and, in fairness to the other children, it&#x2019;s not as if I hadn&#x2019;t earned my social standing. People usually picture nerds as introverted, maybe even antisocial. Certainly many are, but I think some are like me: extroverts of such intensity that it makes others uncomfortable.<br><br>I once told my classmates that I was a werewolf&#x2014;�a fact about which I was absolutely convinced.<br><br>Then there&#x2019;s the fact that I cried at the drop of a hat, something other grade-�school boys take in with the excitement of a shark smelling blood.<br><br>At recess, tag was the worst. I ran like someone wading through molasses, and my classmates knew that once I was &#x201c;it,&#x201d; there was no way for me to transfer that dishonor to anyone else. When the alpha kids discovered this, they began running backward and chanting, &#x201c;water tank, water tank,&#x201d; making fun of the way my belly made waves when I ran. I was easy prey&#x2014;�a fat, ginger gazelle in &#x201c;husky&#x201d; jeans.<br><br>By second grade, every recess had come to represent a choice: I could try to play with other kids and be bullied, or I could seek solitude and make it through without tears or having to call for teacher intervention.<br><br>So I chose solitude. Each day when the recess bell rang, I would make a beeline for the woods at the edge of our playground, where I would pass the time inventing stories to tell myself. This strategy wasn&#x2019;t 100 percent effective. Occasionally a teacher would fetch me from my hiding place because I&#x2019;d ventured too far afield; other times, a bored bully would actively hunt me down. But more often than not, I was out of sight and out of mind, and they left me alone.<br><br>Alone.<br><br>And lonely.<br>I became a Christian when I was seven.<br><br>My family comes from the largest denomination of the conservative Evangelical movement: the Southern Baptist Convention. Southern Baptists believe that people become reconciled to God when they believe that Jesus is the Son of God, who died for the sins of all of humankind, and when they state that belief in a prayer.<br><br>That prayer is called the Sinner&#x2019;s Prayer, a name that says a lot about what it&#x2019;s like to grow up in that wing of the church. Southern Baptists believe that all people are born sinners. Humans are in love with pleasure, power, and prestige, and our natural inclination is to follow our sinful natures into all sorts of trouble. This isn&#x2019;t too far-�fetched an idea. I carry 40 pounds of evidence of this tendency around my midsection.<br><br>But most Southern Baptists take it further, believing that people are completely hopeless without God, and that anyone who isn&#x2019;t saved through faith in Jesus goes to hell&#x2014;�an actual, physical place of eternal, fiery torment and suffering. This concept can do a number on the imagination of a seven-�year-�old kid, which was the age my friends and I were when we heard it. Many children express interest in salvation right around the time they&#x2019;re old enough to grasp this concept of eternal torment. Some of my friends remember having nightmares in which their &#x201c;unsaved&#x201d; friends roasted in fiery pits while they looked down from heaven&#x2019;s paradise.<br><br>I&#x2019;m thankful to report that this wasn&#x2019;t my experience. I was fortunate to grow up in a congregation that focused on the hope of salvation&#x2014;�a message that was more carrot than stick. People at my family&#x2019;s church talked about having Jesus in your heart and the Holy Spirit in your life. God was someone who helped you make the right decisions, understand the Bible, and find peace no matter what was happening around you. That sounded wonderful to my small ears.<br><br>One night after coming home from church, I interrogated my parents about salvation. Even as a kid, I was never the kind of person who accepts information without scrutiny, and I wanted to see if I could find or poke any holes in this salvation concept. I don&#x2019;t remember this conversation, but my mother tells me it was remarkably businesslike. I wanted to know how, exactly, the process worked. What words did I say to be saved? What did God do, exactly, when I said those words? How would I know that God was doing His part? After nearly an hour, my curiosity was sated, and I went to get ready for bed.<br><br>I usually fall asleep quickly, but I couldn&#x2019;t that night. I felt a sense of urgency, an energy pulsing through my bones. I knew I needed to ask Jesus into my heart, so I grabbed my mom and told her it was time&#x2014;�that I was ready to know Him. Mom asked a few questions and then led me in that Sinner&#x2019;s Prayer as we knelt beside my bed&#x2014;�an altar covered with Snoopy sheets.<br><br>A few weeks later, the congregation baptized me, my teeth chattering in a baptismal pool with a broken heater. My feet didn&#x2019;t reach the bottom of the tank, so I dog-�paddled to the pastor and stood on his boot. Moments later, after I was dunked under that frosty surface in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, the preacher said I was a new creation, and I felt it. I was inspired, and I couldn&#x2019;t wait to share the good news.<br><br>So I didn&#x2019;t. The next day, I went to school and told every one of my classmates that I loved them. Every one of them. Every last boy and every girl&#x2014;�all of them so equally horrified by my pronouncements of love that I found myself in the principal&#x2019;s office.<br><br>My faithful walk with Christ wasn&#x2019;t helping my social standing at school. Maybe I took that &#x201c;ye are . . . a peculiar people&#x201d; thing too literally.<br><br>But my faith did help me in other ways. When I felt lonely hiding in the woods to escape bullies, I would talk to Jesus. I talked to him about feeling fat, slow, and stupid. Sometimes I would ask him why, if he truly loved me, he had made me the way he did. Other times, I asked Jesus to make me able to hit a home run or run a mile without stopping, and I would imagine the admiration and accolades that would come from the other kids when such a miracle happened. I didn&#x2019;t think it was too much to ask. Jesus was God, after all, and God had parted a sea for His people. All I was asking for was one lousy home run.<br><br>I never got that home run, but at least Jesus was a good listener. He never made fun of me, either.<br><br>Our talks weren&#x2019;t all lament and pleading. We had a lot of fun, too. We&#x2019;d talk about how the world worked and all the things in nature that amazed me. I didn&#x2019;t have any friends at school, but that was OK. My best friend lived in my heart.<br><br>These days, people often tell me I&#x2019;m smart. Every time I hear it, I&#x2019;m amazed, because no one made that assumption during my first few years of school.<br><br>I had a hard time learning to write and spell. Around the time my classmates were forming legible letterforms, my scrawl still looked like preschool graffiti. And even though I loved to read, my spelling was atrocious&#x2014;�bad enough, in fact, that I was put in a special class for a few hours each week. It was a strange class, one that housed both the smartest kids and the kids who had trouble learning.<br><br>My parents kept having to come to school to talk with my teachers about my unrealized potential. The teachers would tell them that I needed to work harder and apply myself. A couple of them said I was smart but lazy. I believed them. I hated myself for being so lazy.<br><br>At the end of each school year, my grades were usually good enough for me to advance to the next level but bad enough to initiate a serious talk about holding me back. Each year this talk got a little more serious. I&#x2019;d probably still be in the third grade had it not been for a miracle that saved my academic career.<br><br>My school got computers. And computers changed everything.<br><br>In those days, computers were expensive and unproven, and they weren&#x2019;t kept in every classroom. They had their own special domain&#x2014;�a small room where the Apple IIs, with their green-�on-�black screens and giant floppy disks, were kept in two rows.<br><br>Computers and I became fast friends. You could press a key, and a letter would appear on the screen as if by magic. I felt none of the frustration I usually experienced when forming handwritten letters. Before long, I was crafting words and sentences with ease. This didn&#x2019;t free me from the tyranny of penmanship, but it at least helped my teachers see that I wasn&#x2019;t a hopeless case.<br><br>Before long, I had taught myself the basics of programming by modifying the educational video games the teachers gave us to play. I would figure out how to name fish after myself in a game called Odell Lake or get extra money in The Oregon Trail. One day, I created a program that would write my name on the screen over and over again. Everything about the machines made sense to me, because their abstract, procedural way of thinking resembled my own.</p><h2>Classical Music: Third Ear: The Essential Listening Companion</h2><p>(Book). Ranging from Gregorian chant to Philip Glass, this well-balanced guide to historical and contemporary classical music examines major works by 500 composers worldwide. It focuses on exemplary recordings of symphonies, operas, concertos, choral pieces, chamber music, piano pieces and other works performed by an international spectrum of premier conductors, musicians and vocalists. Incisive, often anecdotal critiques define the distinctive style and interpretation of thousands of selected works and recordings. Composers profiled and reviewed include: Bach, Beethoven, Bernstein, Brahms, Chopin, Copland, Czerny, Debussy, Gershwin, Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Prokofieff, Puccini, Reich, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, Varese, Wagner and hundreds of others.</p><p>Alexander Morin founded the Aldine Publishing Company. He lives in Washington, D.C.This excellent guide to classical music discography ranges over the entire history of recorded sound, with 50-plus contributors covering some 500 composers. In contrast to most guides of its kind, headnote information (e.g., label, disc numbers, performers, and the like) is presented in the text in summary form only, with boldface alerting readers to particular performers and recommended recordings. Usually, a composer entry begins with a short assessment of the composer's work and historical significance, followed by a discussion of the recordings. Besides the main 1100-page composer section, editor Morin, a contributor to several prestigious musical publications, allotted sections to genres and instruments/artists. The main competition to this work is The Penguin Guide to Compact Discs, out in a new edition this year. Both are mammoth works, but some minor composers/works in one are not in the other (and vice versa). For certain major composers, Penguin is superior, but in general the nod goes to the newcomer, especially for its coverage of "genre" music not included in Penguin (the film music of Korngold, for example, is not mentioned in Penguin) and more complete entries on important minor composers (such as Viotti). Ideally, libraries should own both books to cover the classical scene fully. (The "About the Book" section of Classical Music states that, like Penguin, it will be updated periodically.) This fascinating and readable survey is recommended for all libraries.<br><i>Bruce R. Schueneman, Texas A&amp;M Univ.

He lives in the Midwest with his wife and son. <i>The Yard</i> is his first novel.<b>Prologue</b><p></p><p><i>LONDON, 1889.</i></p><p>Nobody noticed when Inspector Christian Little of Scotland Yard disappeared, and nobody was looking for him when he was found. A black steamer trunk appeared at Euston Square Station some</p>time during the night and remained unnoticed until early afternoon of the following day. The porter discovered it after the one o&#x2019;clock train had departed, and he opened the trunk when it proved too heavy for him to lift.<p></p><p>He immediately sent a boy to find the police.</p><p>Detective Inspector Walter Day was first at the scene, and he directed the many bobbies who arrived after him. He had come to London only the week before. This was his first crime scene and he was clearly nervous, but the blue-uniformed bobbies knew their job well and did not require much from him. They pushed back the commuters who had gathered round the trunk and began to scour the station for possible weapons and other clues.</p><p>An hour later, Dr Bernard Kingsley entered the station all in a rush and headed for the knot of people gathered on the gallery of the booking office. The trunk had been left against the railing overlooking the platform. Kingsley brushed past Inspector Day and knelt on the floor.</p><p>He opened his satchel and drew out a cloth tape measure, snaked it between his fingers, moving it up and across. The trunk was a standard size, two by three by three, glossy black with tin rivets along the seams. He closed the lid and brushed a finger across the top. It was clean; no dust.</p><p>With his magnifying glass in hand, he scuttled around the trunk, scru</p>tinizing the corners for wear. He licked his finger and rubbed a seam along one side where black paint had been applied to cover a crack. He was aware of Day hovering over his shoulder and, less intrusive, the bobbies at the sta<p></p>tion&#x2019;s entrance pushing back fresh onlookers who had arrived from the street outside. The lower classes were always out for a spectacle, while the better-off walked briskly past, ignoring the to-do.<p></p><p>His preliminary examination out of the way, Kingsley opened and shut the trunk&#x2019;s lid several times, listening to the hinges, then eased it back until the edge of the lid rested against the floor. He peered into the trunk for a long moment, ignoring the sickly sweet odor of death. The body inside was folded in on itself, knotted and mashed into the too-small space like so much laundry. One shoe was missing, and Kingsley presumed it was some</p>where at the bottom of the trunk, under the body. The man&#x2019;s suit was gabardine, the hems lightly worn, dirt pressed into the creases. His arms and legs were broken and wrapped around one another.<p></p><p>Kingsley took a pair of tongs from his satchel and used them to move an arm out of the way so he could see the man&#x2019;s face. The skin was pearl grey and the eyes and mouth were sewn shut with heavy thread, the pattern of parallel stitches like train tracks across the man&#x2019;s lips. Kingsley looked up at Day. When he spoke, his voice was low and measured.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you identified him yet?&#x201d;</p><p>Day shook his head no.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s one of you,&#x201d; Kingsley said.</p><p>&#x201c;One of me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The body is that of a detective. This is Inspector Little.&#x201d;</p><p>Day backed away to the railing and held up his hands, warding off the unpleasant thought.</p><p>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be. I spoke with Little just last evening.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley shrugged.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that I doubt you,&#x201d; Day said. &#x201c;But Inspector Little . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Come and see for yourself,&#x201d; Kingsley said.</p><p>Day stared at him.</p><p>&#x201c;I said come here. Please.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p><p>Day approached the trunk and swallowed hard before looking down.</p><p>&#x201c;Breathe through your mouth, Mr Day. The odor isn&#x2019;t pleasant.&#x201d;</p><p>Day nodded, panting heavily.</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose it is Mr Little. But what have they done to him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can see what&#x2019;s been done. The question is why has it been done?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s inhuman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid it&#x2019;s all too human.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cut those off him. Get that off his face. We can&#x2019;t have a detective of the Yard trussed up like a . . . like a Christmas goose, for God&#x2019;s sake.&#x201d;</p><p>One of the uniformed constables standing at the rail looked up. The station was full of citizens who didn&#x2019;t care about the dead detective in the trunk just so long as they got a chance to see him. Day recognized the ter</p>ror in the constable&#x2019;s eyes and could see that he had no idea why he was doing this dangerous job for little money and no respect. In that single mo<p></p>ment, in the expression he saw in the other man&#x2019;s eyes, Day understood that London needed her police, but did not care about them. And he saw, too, that this newfound discovery was something that every policeman on that platform already understood.<p></p><p>The morale of the Metropolitan Police Force had reached its lowest point during the Ripper murders of the previous year and had not yet re</p>covered. The files of the Whitechapel murders had not been closed as the case was still ongoing, but nobody in London trusted the police to do their job. Jack had escaped and the detectives of the Yard had never even come close to finding him. The unsolved case was a harsh reminder of their fal<p></p>libility, and it hung over their heads every morning when they walked through the door of the back hall. The Ripper was still out there some<p></p>where, and it was likely he&#x2019;d remain out there.<p></p><p>Kingsley stood and put a hand on Day&#x2019;s shoulder. When he spoke, his voice was barely audible.</p><p>&#x201c;I will most assuredly make Inspector Little presentable again. There will be a time and a place to mourn him. Here and now, you must fix your mind on justice. It is not outside the realm of possibility that Little&#x2019;s killer is watching us, and your demeanor may set the course for the investigation to come. You must appear to be strong and rational.&#x201d;</p><p>Day nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;To work, then,&#x201d; Kingsley said.</p><p>He grabbed a handle and lifted one end of the trunk, grunted, and set it back down.</p><p>&#x201c;Inspector Day,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you look like an able fellow. Lift this end, would you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where shall I put it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not the entirety of the trunk, just pull upward on the handle and get this thing off the ground a bit, would you?&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley removed his hat and set it on a bench along the far wall of the gallery. He draped his coat over the arm of the bench and strode back to where Day had an end of the trunk lifted off the ground. The two men were a study in contrasts. Dr Kingsley was short and thin with sharply chiseled features and wild, prematurely grey hair that matched his eyes. Inspector Day was tall and built like an ox through the chest and shoulders. His short dark hair was combed back from his wide forehead, and his expression was permanently helpful, as if he were in search of an old lady he might escort across the street. He displayed the easy physical confidence that some big men had, but his features were fine and sensitive and his eyes were sad. Kingsley found it impossible to dislike the young detective.</p><p>&#x201c;Higher, would you?&#x201d; Kingsley said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s better.&#x201d;</p><p>He got down on his hands and knees and crawled under the end of the trunk, Day straining above him. It didn&#x2019;t occur to him that Day might drop the trunk on his head. Men like Day used their brains to move their mus</p>cles about. Their muscles were useful enough.<p></p><p>Kingsley inspected the planks of the platform floor, peering into crevices in the ancient wood, worn smooth by the shoes of countless travelers.</p><p>&#x201c;Aha!&#x201d; he said. He scrambled backward until his head was clear of the bottom of the trunk and stood up, using one hand to smooth his waistcoat over his stomach. The thumb and index finger of his other hand were pinched together, and he held them up to the light.</p><p>Day squinted.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a hair,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;No, lad. It&#x2019;s a thread. This end is frayed a bit where it&#x2019;s been cut. Here, you see?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The same thread used to sew his mouth and eyes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Different color. That was black. This is dark blue. It could be a coinci</p>dence, someone lost a thread from her coat, perhaps, but I don&#x2019;t think so. I think your killer came prepared with at least two colors of thread. And why would that be?&#x201d;<p></p><p>He abruptly dropped to the ground and began to crawl around the plat</p>form, his magnifying glass playing over the surface, his long fingers poking into the corners where the wall joined the planks of the floor. After several long minutes in which the onlookers behind the railing began to grow rest<p></p>less, Kingsley murmured an exclamation and held his finger up to the light. A drop of blood formed on his fingertip, and Kingsley smiled. He sucked the blood from his finger and turned his magnifying glass around, using the blunt handle to scrape dirt away from the wall.<p></p><p>He stood and trotted back to where Day was still holding up an end of the trunk. Kingsley held out his hand, displaying his find for Day to see.</p><p>&#x201c;Needles,&#x201d; Day said.</p><p>Kingsley grinned. &#x201c;Three needles, Inspector Day. Three, where one might do. I&#x2019;d say our killer&#x2019;s made a telling mistake. Give me your hand</p>kerchief.&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x201c;Is it in my breast pocket?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see one there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I may have come out without it today.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley nodded and turned to the nearest constable.</p><p>&#x201c;You there, have you a handkerchief ?&#x201d;</p><p>A tall, lanky constable looked up from the side of the platform where he seemed to be scanning the crowd. His eyes were bright and intelligent and nearly hidden behind long feminine lashes. He jumped slightly at the sound of Kingsley&#x2019;s voice.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d; Kingsley said.</p><p>&#x201c;Hammersmith, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sound Welsh, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re watching the crowd?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What the detective said, about it being another detective in the box, it surprised people.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You were looking to see who among that crowd wasn&#x2019;t surprised. Who might have already known there was a detective in the trunk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t see anything unexpected.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley nodded. &#x201c;Still,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;it was a worthy idea. How long have you been with the force?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two years, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised I haven&#x2019;t made your acquaintance before this. I shall watch your career with interest. Now, I wonder if I might borrow your handkerchief?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Mr Hammersmith.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley took the offered kerchief and glanced at it. He looked up at the constable.</p><p>&#x201c;This is not particularly clean.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I apologize, sir. I&#x2019;ve been at it now for two shifts and haven&#x2019;t had a chance to launder anything.&#x201d;</p><p>Indeed, Hammersmith looked sloppy. His blue uniform was wrinkled, his shirt was untucked on one side, and the cuffs of his trousers were muddy. There was a hangdog air about him, but in his body language and bearing he somehow gave the impression of utter competence.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, well, thank you, Hammersmith. I shall return this as soon as I possibly can.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley wrapped the needles in the soiled square of cloth. He tucked the handkerchief and the short piece of blue thread into his vest pocket to be examined later.</p><p>&#x201c;This one is a challenge. A real challenge.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley smiled and scanned the platform one last time, barely taking in the crowd of onlookers.</p><p>&#x201c;Wonderful,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Simply wonderful. You can let that down now.&#x201d;</p><p>Day eased the end of the heavy trunk back to the platform floor and breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>&#x201c;Have two of the men bring that round to the college,&#x201d; Kingsley said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll want to examine Little&#x2019;s body, but I&#x2019;m not going to do it here. Have the rest of these bobbies search the platform carefully for a man&#x2019;s left shoe. I suspect it&#x2019;s in the trunk, but there&#x2019;s no harm in putting them to work.&#x201d;</p><p>Kingsley shrugged back into his coat, picked up his hat, and walked away. Halfway to the far edge of the platform, he turned and walked back to where Day still stood. He leaned in and whispered so the onlookers wouldn&#x2019;t overhear. &#x201c;Shut the lid on that trunk,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want that rabble ogling a dead detective.&#x201d;</p></p><h2>Uglies (The Uglies, 1)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY. A thought-provoking and chilling look at a society in which the government attempts to control how everyone looks, acts, and thinks.</p><p>Playing on every teen&#x2019;s passionate desire to look as good as everybody else, Scott Westerfeld (<i>Midnighters</i>) projects a future world in which a compulsory operation at sixteen wipes out physical differences and makes everyone pretty by conforming to an ideal standard of beauty. The "New Pretties" are then free to play and party, while the younger "Uglies" look on enviously and spend the time before their own transformations in plotting mischievous tricks against their elders. Tally Youngblood is one of the most daring of the Uglies, and her imaginative tricks have gotten her in trouble with the menacing department of Special Circumstances. She has yearned to be pretty, but since her best friend Shay ran away to the rumored rebel settlement of recalcitrant Uglies called The Smoke, Tally has been troubled. The authorities give her an impossible choice: either she follows Shay&#x2019;s cryptic directions to The Smoke with the purpose of betraying the rebels, or she will never be allowed to become pretty. Hoping to rescue Shay, Tally sets off on the dangerous journey as a spy. But after finally reaching The Smoke she has a change of heart when her new lover David reveals to her the sinister secret behind becoming pretty. The fast-moving story is enlivened by many action sequences in the style of videogames, using intriguing inventions like hoverboards that use the rider&#x2019;s skateboard skills to skim through the air, and bungee jackets that make wild downward plunges survivable -- and fun. Behind all the commotion is the disturbing vision of our own society -- the Rusties -- visible only in rusting ruins after a virus destroyed all petroleum. Teens will be entranced, and the cliffhanger ending will leave them gasping for the sequel.

Tour.</p><p>James S. Olson is professor of history at Sam Houston State University.Although John Wayne is arguably the most popular actor in history--he ranked among the top 10 box-office attractions for 25 consecutive years--he's been relatively neglected by film scholars. Prefatorily, Roberts and Olson grind the ax that Wayne has been marginalized by pop-culture elitists because of his political conservatism, which, as they point out, was always "outspoken but nonideological." Yet they provide a balanced, thoroughly researched portrait that traces his career from a lengthy apprenticeship in countless western potboilers through the wartime films that established his character as an American ideal to the later ones that played upon his real-life status as a proud but anachronistic icon. They're particularly insightful about the development of Wayne's distinctive acting style--the halting cadence of his speech, his distinctive walk, and other studied mannerisms. Wayne's movies remain hugely popular 15 years after his death, and indeed, he starred in some of Hollywood's finest films, as those pop-culture elitists will attest; still, this is the first substantive, serious biography of him and, as such, fills a big gap. <i>Gordon Flagg</i></p><h2>Monogamy</h2><p>In his preface to this highly charged volume, psychologist <b>Adam Phillips</b> suggests that today's raging controversies over the nature of marriage and the soaring divorce rate are actually discussions about monogamy: What brings people together?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should they, in fact, stay together?&nbsp;&nbsp;"What are couples for," he asks, "if they are not for pleasure?&nbsp;&nbsp;And if pleasure doesn't matter, then what does?"<br><br>Phillips gives us 120 deliberately arguable aphorisms ("Every marriage is a blind date that makes you wonder what the alternatives are to a blind date." or "As yet, the promiscuous cannot grow old gracefully. But this may say more about our ideas of dignity, than of aging.") that discuss the concept of monogamy from every angle, discovering what it is and what it isn't, uncovering in it "a kind of moral nexus, a keyhole through which we can spy on our preoccupations."<br><br>No reader will come away from this wholly unexpected book without feeling challenged to re-evaluate, and perhaps reconstruct, the time-honored (or is it time-hardened?) notions we hold about monogamy.</p><p>"The right reader, seduced by Monogamy's wry aperus, tickled by its insights, and ravished by its provocations, only has to lie back and enjoy.

Our emotions play a vital role in living happy, healthy, successful lives. All emotions, from love and joy to anger and fear, have an important part to play in understanding ourselves and others. They help us discover the wonders of this life as well as warn us when we are in danger. But this diversity of feelings is meant to complement our life, not determine it! In this life-transforming book, Joyce Meyer reveals powerful truths from God&#39;s Word that will help you learn to manage all of your emotions in the right direction. Through hilarious illustrations and real-life applications, Joyce delivers the keys to keeping your emotions in the proper place while allowing the Spirit of God to lead and direct you. Dynamic scriptural insights are included on topics such as: * How not to be led by feelings * Codependency * Forgiveness * Mood swings * Healing for damaged emotions * Depression * And much more! Don&#39;t allow your feelings to determine your destiny! Instead, manage your emotions to complement and enhance your attitude for a joyful, victorious life!</p><p>JOYCE MEYER has been teaching the Word of God since 1976 and in full-time ministry since 1980. Previously an associate pastor at Life Christian Church in St. Louis, Missouri, she developed, coordinated, and taught a weekly meeting known as "Life In The Word." After more than five years, the Lord brought it to a conclusion, directing her to establish her own ministry and call it "Life In The Word, Inc." <p>Now, her Life In The Word radio and television broadcasts are seen and heard by millions across the United States and throughout the world. Joyce's teaching tapes are enjoyed internationally, and she travels extensively conducting Life In The Word conferences. </p><p>Joyce and her husband, Dave, the business administrator at Life In The Word, have been married for over 35 years. They reside in St. Louis, Missouri, and are the parents of four children. All four children are married and, along with their spouses, work with Dave and Joyce in the ministry. </p><p>Believing the call on her life is to establish believers in God's Word, Joyce says, "Jesus died to set the captives free, and far too many Christians have little or no victory in their daily lives." Finding herself in the same situation many years ago and having found freedom to live in victory through applying God's Word, Joyce goes equipped to set captives free and to exchange ashes for beauty. She believes that every person who walks in victory leads many others into victory. Her life is transparent, and her teachings are practical and can be applied in everyday life. </p><p>Joyce has taught on emotional healing and related subjects in meetings all over the country, helping multiplied thousands. She has recorded more than 230 different audio-cassette albums and over 75 videos. She has also authored 49 books to help the body of Christ on various topics.</p>&#34;We want people to receive healing in every area of life--spiritually, mentally, emotionally, physically, financially, and socially.

The truth is, most diets work for a while, but there&#x2019;s usually a point at which the dietary restrictions become too difficult to maintain. Why? Because whether you&#x2019;re following a low-carb, paleo, gluten-free, or even an all-liquid green juice diet, the addictive nature of sugar causes cravings to take over and sabotage your diet-of-the-moment.<br><br> In <i>Why Diets Fail</i>, Dr. Nicole M. Avena and John R. Talbott reveal definitive proof that sugar is addictive and present the first science-based program to stop the cravings and lose weight&#x2014;permanently. A neuroscientist and food addiction expert, Dr. Avena has conducted groundbreaking research showing that sugar triggers the same responses in the brain as addictive drugs like cocaine, nicotine, and alcohol. And like those other substances, the more sugar you eat, the more you need to get the same pleasurable feelings. (No wonder your last diet didn&#x2019;t stick.) <br><br> Avena and Talbott&#x2019;s eight-step plan walks you through the process of going sugar-free and surviving the make-or-break withdrawal period&#x2014;those first few weeks when your body feels the absence of its favorite sweetener most acutely. An easy-to-use Sugar Equivalency Table developed by Talbott lists the amount of sugar in hundreds of common foods so you know precisely what to eat and what to avoid. And when it comes to what you can eat, you have a lot to choose from. In fact, you&#x2019;ll probably eat more on this diet than you normally do&#x2014;while continuing to lose weight.<br><br> This science-based program is the diet to end all diets. It will help you break the yo-yo dieting cycle, end those maddening sugar cravings, and develop a new longing for the good food that will keep you fit, healthy, and happy.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Author Q&amp;A</b></p> <p><strong>Q. What do you mean when you talk about sugar addition? I don't take sugar in coffee or add it to my food, so I would say I can&#x2019;t be addicted to sugar &#x2013; can I?</strong></p> <p>A. Even if you are not deliberately adding sugar to your drinks or food, sugar is already an ingredient in many foods and beverages &#x2013; some of which you might not expect. This book discusses which types of foods and drinks contain high amounts of sugar and includes a questionnaire to help readers see if they show signs of a sugar addiction.</p> <p><strong>Q. What is a 'hidden' sugar, and how do I discover which foods contain them?</strong></p> <p>A. Hidden sugars are sugars contained in foods or beverages that you might not suspect. We know that many dessert items, such as ice cream and pastries, contain high amounts of sugar, but there are also a number of food and drink items that you may not expect to contain a lot of sugar, including certain yogurts, energy bars, barbecue sauces, etc. Hidden sugars can be identified by looking carefully at a food or beverage&#x2019;s nutrition label, a topic we discuss further in the book.</p> <p><strong>Q. How does your eating program handle eating out and holiday times, especially if there are hidden sugars everywhere?</strong></p> <p>A. This book discusses the types of foods that tend to be high in sugar and that may contain hidden sugars, as well as the social factors that may influence food choices, equipping readers with information to make eating out and holidays less challenging.</p> <p><strong>Q. If I cut out the hidden sugars from my diet, will I be able to lose weight?</strong></p> <p>A. If you were to continue to eat the exact same way you have been minus hidden sugars, which also mean hidden calories, you would most likely lose weight, and this weight loss would be even greater if you cut out or reduced the other major sources of sugar in your diet.</p> <p><strong>Q. Is sugar really addictive? When people say they have a chocolate craving &#x2013; are they being serious, or just saying that so they can eat what they like?</strong></p> <p>A. According to the research from our laboratory and others&#x2019;, binge eating sugar results in similar behavior and brain changes as drug addiction, suggesting that sugar can be addictive. This does not mean that everyone who eats sugar or claims to have a craving for a sugary food is addicted; people often use the term &#x201c;addiction&#x201d; in everyday life to refer to their love of sports, online shopping, etc., however, there are certain criteria that are used in the medical field to identify substance dependence. As discussed in the book, these criteria have recently been adapted to refer to food instead of drugs and studies have shown certain individuals to meet the criteria for food addiction.</p><p>NICOLE M.

Then Daryl suffers a brief cardiac arrest during a race, and suddenly Curt is The Man in the half-mile--not just to his schoolmates but to Daryl's relentlessly competitive father as well. Driven by jealousy and a need to reclaim his father's regard, Daryl quickly regains his form, but collapses and dies in the championship race. Hoffius re-creates the excitement of racing and winning with a sure touch. Curt--his loyalty, concern, and new-found pride pulling him in different directions--displays nicely balanced ambivalence toward his friend's return. Daryl's father is definitely the villain, with a cruel disregard for his son's feelings and silently condoning his decision to rejoin the team, but, as the author makes clear, Daryl is also a victim of his own anger and ego. Though the characters and situations here are simpler than in Deuker's Heart of a Champion (p. 658)--not to mention Brooks's The Moves Make the Man- -the dangers of a ``win at any cost'' father are explored with some insight. (Fiction. 10-14) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Curtis is shocked when Daryl Wagner, his best friend and high school track teammate, collapses from cardiac arrest during a tough race. Good-looking, popular, an all-around athlete and A-student, Daryl has seemed the embodiment of perfect health, and findings of an irregular heart are in sharp contrast to his youthful vigor. Mr. Wagner, the boys' intensely competitive personal coach, now shifts his focus onto Curtis--training him harder and elevating him to "second son" status, a position both teenagers resent. Hoffius's first novel has lots of runner-related jargon and play-by-play action that compensates for implausible plot developments (would the sports-mad Mr. Wagner really encourage a son diagnosed with a cardiac condition to resume track? And would the school allow him to rejoin the team?). Although Curtis's frank narrative exposes frailties (jealously, vanity, intolerance) that would otherwise render him unsympathetic, one can't help cheering him on and then experiencing his devastation in the abrupt, catastrophic final scene.

Now, in a revealing work of historical biography, Edward Lengel has written the definitive account of George Washington the soldier.<br><br>Based largely on Washington&#x2019;s personal papers, this engrossing book paints a vivid, factual portrait of a man to whom lore and legend so tenaciously cling. To Lengel, Washington was the imperfect commander. Washington possessed no great tactical ingenuity, and his acknowledged &#x201c;brilliance in retreat&#x201d; only demonstrates the role luck plays in the fortunes of all great men. He was not an enlisted man&#x2019;s leader; he made a point of never mingling with his troops. He was not an especially creative military thinker; he fought largely by the book. <br><br>He was not a professional, but a citizen soldier, who, at a time when warfare demanded that armies maneuver efficiently in precise formation, had little practical training handling men in combat. Yet despite his flaws, Washington was a remarkable figure, a true man of the moment, a leader who possessed a clear strategic, national, and continental vision, and who inspired complete loyalty from his fellow revolutionaries, officers, and enlisted men. America could never have won freedom without him.<br><br>A trained surveyor, Washington mastered topography and used his superior knowledge of battlegrounds to maximum effect. He appreciated the importance of good allies in times of crisis, and understood well the benefits of coordination of ground and naval forces. Like the American nation itself, he was a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts&#x2013;a remarkable everyman whose acts determined the course of history. Lengel argues that Washington&#x2019;s excellence was in his completeness, in how he united the military, political, and personal skills necessary to lead a nation in war and peace. <br><br>At once informative and engaging, and filled with some eye-opening revelations about Washington, the war for American independence, and the very nature of military command, General George Washington is a book that reintroduces readers to a figure many think they already know.</p><p>EDWARD LENGEL is associate professor of history at the University of Virginia and associate editor of The Papers of George Washington. A specialist in military history, he is the author of W<i>orld War I Memories</i> and <i>The Irish Through British Eyes</i>.1 <br>YOUNG FRONTIERSMAN <br><br>May 1741 &#x2013; February 1753 At the end of May 1741, a young American officer stood sweltering on the sun-baked deck of a warship off the coast of Jamaica. Transports full of red-coated soldiers surrounded him, clogging the horizon with wooden hulls, masts, and sails that announced the presence of a British expeditionary army. As a captain in the provincial infantry, he occupied only a small corner of that army, and counted for little; but as an American he felt proud to participate in Great Britain&#x2019;s glorious military tradition. Or at least he had at first. Now all reason for pride had gone. The army was dying. It had won no laurels, just a watery shroud. Most of the men had perished in the last four months, and disease stalked every survivor. As the American captain watched, daily burials at sea became feasts for frenzied sharks. He had no reason to think that he would not end the same way. Officers enjoyed no immunity to tropical disease or ignominious burial. Like all soldiers, Captain Lawrence Washington found refuge in thoughts of home. He came from Fredericksburg, Virginia, over a thousand miles away. He had not been there in over a year. Letters took weeks to travel each way, and often never arrived at all. Still, writing to his loved ones could make them seem closer, so retreating from the sun to his cabin or a shady place on deck, he turned from the horrors surrounding him, took up a pen, and wrote a letter to his father.<br><br>Lawrence Washington wrote as a recent eyewitness to the most important battle of the War of Jenkins&#x2019; Ear, and as a participant in its miserable aftermath. Named after the alleged mutilation of English sailor Robert Jenkins, the conflict had started in the summer of 1739 as a minor colonial fray between Great Britain and Spain. The bloodletting centered in the Caribbean, where the British sought to strangle Spain&#x2019;s communications with the gold and silver mines of South America by snatching some of her outposts. Victors of the war&#x2019;s early encounters, the British expected to make short work of the decrepit Spanish empire by capturing the important port of Cartagena off the northeast coast of South America. After this, with the Spanish reeling, they expected to move on to seize the even more important settlement of Havana on the island of Cuba. As plans for its Caribbean offensive jelled in 1739, the British government announced its intention to form an American regiment to serve as part of an amphibious army of six marine regiments and other regular units. Virginia, whose governor was appointed to command the regiment, provided the largest number of volunteers when recruitment began in the spring of 1740. The common Virginians made unimpressive soldiers&#x2014;a British observer called them &#x201c;Blacksmiths, Tailors, Barbers, Shoemakers, and all the Banditry the colonies afford&#x201d;&#x2014;but their officers were privileged, cultured, and generally intelligent young men, anxious to earn good reputations in battle. Sons of the Old Dominion had besieged colonial officials with requests for commissions, and Lawrence Washington was one of the many who lobbied fiercely for the four captaincies available from his colony. Thanks to his family&#x2019;s influence and his own considerable personal charm, he received the highest-ranking spot. <br><br>The newly appointed Captain Washington followed the American Regiment to Jamaica near the end of 1740. At first, his soldiers showed little promise. Like the British redcoats, the American enlisted men came from the scum of society; and the Virginians stood out even in such rough company. Among them were vagrants, loafers, cutpurses, and former convicts. Soldiering did not come naturally to them, as Lawrence and his fellow officers swiftly discovered. They looked bad, too. Only about one in every six of the scrawny, ill-fed men possessed a uniform. British Brigadier General Thomas Wentworth reviewed the Americans on Jamaica in January 1741 and shook his head at the spectacle they presented. Yet there was some innate quality in the common soldiers that he liked. Under proper leadership and discipline, he decided, they might eventually prove useful. For American officers, on the other hand, he expressed complete and unreserved contempt. Branding them na�ve and stupid, and certain that they would falter in combat, he attempted to replace them with British regulars. But by then the scruffy American enlisted soldiers had bonded with their young officers, and they bluntly refused to serve under anyone else. Irritated, Wentworth relented, but he privately resolved to keep all of the Americans on shipboard during the approaching campaign. It was inconceivable to him that the redcoats might need their provincial allies&#x2019; support. Wentworth commanded the land element of the expeditionary force of 8,000 British regulars and 3,000 Americans that left Jamaica in February 1741. The fleet carrying his troops sailed under Admiral Edward Vernon, a fifty-five-year-old, ill-tempered naval commander known in the fleet as &#x201c;Grog&#x201d; because of his grogram cloak. Sailors also applied this nickname to the watered-down rum that he forced upon them. But the ribbing was good- natured. Vernon&#x2019;s capture of Porto Bello on the Panamanian isthmus in November 1739 had made him a popular hero. Capturing Cartagena would add to his reputation and clear the way for other conquests in the Caribbean. The fleet dropped anchor off Cartagena in early March 1741, and the redcoats quickly debarked, eager to fight. Yet their enthusiasm availed little in the ensuing six weeks as the expedition foundered and disintegrated. The British easily invested the port, but instead of storming its fortifications, Vernon and Wentworth quarreled over the plan of attack. <br><br>Finally, after weeks of dithering that left the troops gravely weakened by dysentery and malaria, the British launched a large-scale assault on April 9th. Their officers bungled the advance, and the well-entrenched Spanish refused to budge. Nearly 700 redcoats fell slain without penetrating the enemy entrenchments. The siege then stalled while the British returned to the ships where their American allies had spent the last month languishing in stifling heat. Though spared the horrors of battle, the colonials had not been able to avoid the equally appalling threats of heatstroke, fever, and disease. British surgeons and their assistants&#x2014;among them a young writer named Tobias Smollett&#x2014;struggled to care for the sick and wounded, and as soldiers perished in increasing numbers, discipline collapsed. Officers gave up on their duties and avoided their haggard men. The living casually dumped the bodies of dead comrades overboard, strewing the waters of Cartagena with bloated corpses. The trail of bodies led all the way to Jamaica, where the fleet arrived several weeks after abandoning its siege. But that island offered little relief, and the fever epidemic continued unabated. The army&#x2019;s effective strength rapidly fell to fewer than 2,000 British and just over 1,000 Americans. Captain Lawrence Washington, by some miracle still alive and apparently healthy despite the carnage surrounding him, had the Cartagena fiasco fresh in his mind as he wrote to his father from on board the British warship in May 1741. The crisis continued as he wrote, and the expeditionary force still wasted away. Total disintegration was near. Yet he knew the keen anticipation with which his news-starved family would read his letter. His father would seek war news as well as hints on the state of trade and commerce in the Caribbean. His mother would want to know about Lawrence&#x2019;s health, and to hear about the fates of other friends and relations. And nine-year-old George, Lawrence&#x2019;s half brother, would look for descriptions of the roar of the cannon or the sight of infantry boldly charging the Spanish fortifications. None of them would want to hear about a disaster. Lawrence wrote his letter with a mixture of sulkiness and reticence, providing only the briefest summary of the terrible expedition. He did not, or could not, bear to confess that the American Regiment had succumbed to disease without firing a shot. Instead he hid the truth with gentle boasting, including some lines possibly intended for George. &#x201c;Our Regiment has not recd that treatment we expected,&#x201d; Lawrence wrote, &#x201c;but I am resolved to persivere in the undertaking. War is horrid in fact, but much more so in imagination; We there learn&#x2019;d to live on ordinary diet, to watch much, &amp; disregard the noise, or shot of Cannon.&#x201d; These words must have impressed themselves on the boy&#x2019;s memory, for he echoed them with his own pen thirteen years later.<br><br>Lawrence returned to Fredericksburg in January 1743 after Admiral Vernon discarded his government&#x2019;s grandiose plans for the conquest of the Carib-bean and sent the exhausted troops home. No parades greeted the Americans, who had failed to garner any kind of military glory. Most of the young officers who had left Virginia so confidently in 1740 had not fallen nobly in battle but died in squalid ships&#x2019; holds before being dined upon by sea creatures. Veterans discovered that society had grown used to getting on without them, and the best jobs, honors, and appointments had already been taken by the stay-at-homes. The thought that he had squandered some of the most important years of his life must have lain heavily on Lawrence&#x2019;s mind. Yet a child&#x2019;s love can heal many wounds, as Lawrence learned from his admiring young half brother George. The two came from a large family. Their father, Augustine, born in 1694, was a soft-spoken but energetic and physically powerful man. In 1738 he had settled at Ferry Farm, which stood across the Rappahannock River from Fredericksburg, and he now owned 10,000 acres and fifty slaves. His first wife, Jane Butler, died in 1729 after bearing three children: Lawrence (born around 1717), Augustine Jr., and Jane.

But what he doesn&#39;t know could kill him: the secret powers of Maria, the Italian beauty who has become an English Lady; the Irish fisherman, Moon, who stumbles across the inner workings of an unsuspected cult; and the question they keep asking: the identity of The Widow&#39;s Son.</p><p>Robert Anton Wilson is the coauthor (with the late Robert Shea), of the underground classic The Illuminatus! Trilogy which won the 1986 Prometheus Hall of Fame Award. His other writings include Schrodinger&#39;s Cat Trilogy, called &#34;the most scientific of all science fiction novels&#34; by New Scientist, and many nonfiction works of Futurist psychology and guerilla ontology. Wilson, who sees himself as a Futurist, author, and stand-up comic, regularly gives seminars at Esalan and other New Age centers. Wilson has made both a comedy record (Secrets of Power), and a punk rock record (The Chocolate Biscuit Conspiracy), and his play, Wilhelm Reich in Hell, has been performed throughout the world. His novel Illuminatus! was adapted as a 10-hour science fiction rock epic and performed under the patronage of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II at Great Britain&#39;s National Theatre, where Wilson appeared in a special cameo role. He is also a former editor at Playboy magazine.Devilish...

Why are so many Christians fearful? Why do so many Church leaders sound hateful? Why does religion often create more pain than healing? What would it take for our world to become more gracious? In <em>If Grace Is True,</em> pastors Philip Gulley and James Mulholland revealed their belief that God will save every person. </p><p>They now explore the implications of this belief and its power to change every area of our lives. They attempt to answer one question: If we took God's love seriously, what would our world look like? Gulley and Mulholland argue that what we believe is crucial and dramatically affects the way we live and interact in the world. </p><p>Beliefs have power. The belief in a literal hell, where people suffer eternally, has often been used by the Church to justify hate and violence, which contradict what Jesus taught about love and grace. The authors present a new vision for our personal, religious, and corporate lives, exploring what our world would be like if we based our existence on the foundational truth that God loves every person. Gulley and Mulholland boldly address many controversial issues people in the pews have wondered about but churches have been unwilling to tackle. For too long, the Christian tradition has been steeped in negativity, exclusion, and judgment. Gulley and Mulholland usher us into a new era -- an age where grace and love are allowed to reign.</p></p><p><p>Philip Gulley is a Quaker minister, writer, husband, and father. He is the bestselling author of <em>Front Porch Tales</em>, the acclaimed Harmony series, and is coauthor of <em>If Grace Is True</em> and <em>If God Is Love</em>. Gulley lives with his wife and two sons in Indiana, and is a frequent speaker at churches, colleges, and retreat centers across the country.</p>Gulley, a minister, and Mulholland, a theologian, turn the popular slogan "God is love" into a question that opens a Pandora's box of unanswered queries that some prefer remain unanswerable. If God is love, how are those who profess belief in God to act? If God is love, how does Christianity explain the vastly accepted dualistic theology of heaven and hell? If God is love, how can Christians live in God's grace? How can we continue to hate, slander, murder, and condemn our neighbors? If God is love, and God commands us to love our enemies, how can we justify war? Gently taking organized religion to task for perpetuating its power to control people, and only slightly lacing their discussion with their personal political opinions, the two Quakers propose ways to live, work, play, and be in a state of grace. Many may fault their approach for seeming overly simple at times. Yet anyone searching for a "graciousness primer" might look on this book as a commonsense example of such a manual. <i>Donna Chavez</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She met Michael Stern when they were graduate students at Yale University, at which point the couple set out on a lifelong quest to find the best American food and to write about it. <br> <br> <b>Michael Stern</b> was raised at a Heartland table of square meals. The Sterns <b>&#x2019;</b> monthly &#x201c;Roadfood&#x201d; column in <i>Gourmet</i> magazine has earned them three James Beard Awards for journalism. They are heard weekly on Public Radio's <i>The Splendid Table.</i>The Sterns, authors of Roadfood and other books about America's out-of-the-way, quaint, quirky restaurants, continue their trek across the country with this latest offering. Part traditional chrome and Formica diner, part conventional restaurant (depending on whether you enter from the car park or I-81), the Dutch Kitchen (60 miles northeast of Harrisburg, Pa., in Frackville) offers typical Pennsylvanian cuisine. The restaurant's cooking is bold and filling, consisting of hearty meals to satisfy vigorous appetites and time-honored immigrant dishes. The recipes, which the Sterns gathered from the restaurant's chefs, promote simple, traditional fare with the famous "Dutch" (a possible corruption of "Deutsch," or German) emphasis on the seven sweets and seven sours. Nourishing diner staples like Meatloaf and a beef version of Shepherd's Pie are accompanied by colorful sides like Pickled Eggs, Applesauce Salad and Pennsylvania Dutch Chow-Chow (a relish of assorted pickled vegetables). The authors present the recipes in a plain, no-nonsense manner that assumes a certain knowledge of cooking, as the instructions are sparse almost to the point of paucity. The Sterns also include colorful descriptions of the area and its history, providing a capsule of Americana. This pleasant local cookbook should delight those interested in the German influences on America's culinary history and those with a love for nostalgic heartland favorites. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Years ago, teenager Se�n Hennessey shocked the tight-knit community when he was convicted of the brutal murder of his parents and attempted slaying of his sister, though he always maintained his innocence. Now, Se�n is finally being released from prison&#x2014;but when his newfound freedom coincides with the discovery of two bodies, the alleged connection between the cases only serves to pull Frankie further from answers even as it draws her closer to her town&#x2019;s hidden darkness. With a television documentary revisiting Se�n&#x2019;s sentence pushing the public&#x2019;s sympathies into conflict on a weekly basis, a rabid media pressuring the police like never before, and a rising body count, Frankie will need all of her resources if she is not only to catch a killer, but put to rest what really happened all those years ago.<br><br>A dark, irresistible cocktail of secrets, murder, and family, Olivia Kiernan&#x2019;s latest is an impossible-to-put-down triumph.</p><p><b>Olivia Kiernan</b> is an Irish writer living in the UK. She was born and raised in County Meath near the famed heritage town of Kells and holds an MA in creative writing awarded by the University of Sussex. She is also the author of<i> Too Close to Breathe</i>.***This excerpt is from an advance uncorrected copy proof*** <br><br>Copyright � 2018 Olivia Kiernan<br><br><p><b>C H A P T E R &nbsp;1</b></p><p>There are times<b> </b>in my line of work when I have to sit down with a known killer. Shake their hand. Talk to them. Where I have to let them think we&#x2019;re on a level, that their mind isn&#x2019;t so far from my own. It&#x2019;s a fine balance of control and you want them to believe they have it, even when they don&#x2019;t but especially if they do. You&#x2019;ll get the odd detective, wet behind the ears, who&#x2019;ll talk about building trust, a knowing glint in their eye because they think if a murderer chats with them, they&#x2019;ve won them over, that their perp will peel off their mask and spill all.</p><p>But I&#x2019;ve been doing this long enough to know that when a killer smiles at me, it&#x2019;s not me who&#x2019;s doing the indulging but them doing the tolerating. Thing is, no one really knows what a person is capable of, despite the smile on their face, the firmness of their handshake, or whether they look you in the eye as they lie to you.</p><p>I watch him make his way through the bar, trainers soft, heels sure. He is almost unrecognizable. Another bloke looking for a pint on a Sunday evening. He finds me at the back of the pub, holds out a hand. Fingers flex, shape around mine; calluses, a ridge along the top of his palm. Neat nails clipped back. The muscles bundle in his forearm as he squeezes my hand.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s good to meet you, Detective,&#x201d; he says, smiling. I feel his eyes take in the measure of me and I hope for his sake he&#x2019;s seeing more than a blonde in a suit.</p><p>A man free of his sentence. I watch him put his smile away, pull out a chair, lean strong hands on the table as he sits down. He&#x2019;s tall but I almost match him for height. Overall, he&#x2019;s a good-looking guy. Blue-eyed. A slim build, hair cut short, a fine shade of gold. A man who murdered his parents, tried to murder his younger sister. And the question is not whether he&#x2019;s a murderer but whether fifteen years inside is enough to change a person.</p><p>Tanya West is also sitting at the table. She&#x2019;s keeping it casual. A black T-shirt over blue jeans that could&#x2019;ve come from the teens department. Dark hair pulled back into a high bun, large silver hoops dangling to her shoulders, a silver stud in her nose. I can feel her quick, dark eyes watching the interaction between Hennessy and myself. Tanya is a lawyer. The pain-in-the-backside kind: a defense lawyer. No detective working this side of murder likes defense lawyers. How many times have I watched serious criminals walk because of a crafty defense team? Not to mention that their job is to show up our stupidities, where we&#x2019;ve fucked up, spoken to a suspect at the wrong time, or where the wrong procedure has invalidated solid bloody evidence.</p><p>Defense is the line we have to push our cases across. And Tanya&#x2019;s good at her job. You could catch a perp in the act, elbow deep in the entrails of their victim, and Tanya could convince a court that he&#x2019;d only tripped over the body and landed hands down in the victim&#x2019;s guts. But I can&#x2019;t dislike Tanya. Her aim is not to trick or fool the law but to ask justice to bring its best game. Besides, she&#x2019;s my sister-in-law and I guess family counts for something because there are not many who could persuade me to sit across from a convicted murderer and listen to what he has to say, but Tanya can and has. Although, she was cute enough to keep the fact it was Se�n Hennessy to herself.</p><p>&#x201c;Good to see you again, Se�n,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;Well&#x201d;&#x2014;she slants me a grin&#x2014;&#x201c;now we&#x2019;ve got that warm greeting out of the way. Let&#x2019;s get started.&#x201d;</p><p>I rest back against my seat, unable to move my eyes from Se�n Hennessy. Unable to shake the image of his crimes from my head. The furious mess of murder. The happy spree of knife wounds over his mother&#x2019;s body, his father&#x2019;s. His sister&#x2019;s.</p><p>Tanya places a file on the table and lays her hands on it with a kind of reverence. &#x201c;Se�n, we&#x2019;re very lucky that Frankie is willing to consider your case.&#x201d; She turns, smiles at me. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s one of the best.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course, of course,&#x201d; he murmurs. Lips dry. His tongue clacks in his mouth. Along his hairline, the wet gleam of moisture. He wipes it away with quick fingers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very grateful, Detective.&#x201d;</p><p>Looking at Hennessy is enough to make me doubt the point of my own career. Where&#x2019;s the remorse? Not sitting across from me. He took two lives, almost a third. He&#x2019;s served his time and now here he is. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t do it,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>I rub the base of my neck. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stay long.&#x201d;</p><p>He glances at Tanya then to me, leans back, and runs his hands over his pockets. &#x201c;Well, let me get you a drink. What&#x2019;ll you have?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No thanks. I&#x2019;m on call.&#x201d; He stops. &#x201c;Tanya?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Se�n. A sav blanc, please. Small,&#x201d; she answers.</p><p>He looks to me again, as if he&#x2019;s about to ask me if I&#x2019;m sure, but he thinks better of it. &#x201c;Grand. Grand.&#x201d;</p><p>He gets up, steps away from the table, back through the Sunday punters, head turning from side to side as he works his way to the bar, eyes stalking the room. The pub we&#x2019;re in was a favorite of mine when I still lived at home. It used to be a one-room treasure, where you could fall in the door to a row of bar stools, and that was it. At some point in the last few years, it&#x2019;s been gutted out and extended but the owners have tried to capture that old-bar feel&#x2014;dark wood booths, low ceilings, and dull wooden floors. I watch Se�n step up to order, rest his foot casually on the shining brass footrest that runs along the base of the bar. The barman looks up from the other end of the room, finishes wrapping a set of cutlery in a paper napkin, then approaches Se�n with a nod.</p><p>I lean toward my sister-in-law. &#x201c;Christ, Tanya, you never told me it was Se�n fucking Hennessy you were working with.&#x201d;</p><p>She gives a tiny shrug. The thin hoops of her earrings bounce off her shoulders. &#x201c;You never asked.&#x201d; She fixes her attention on the file. &#x201c;Does it matter who it is? He has a good case for appeal.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He murdered his bloody parents.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s room for doubt.&#x201d; She throws a quick glance at Se�n across the bar, keeps her voice low. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been approached by a production company called Blackthorn Films. They&#x2019;re doing a documentary on Se�n&#x2019;s case. It&#x2019;s due to air in the next week. This could do wonders for our charity&#x2019;s profile.&#x201d;</p><p>Tanya&#x2019;s charity, Justice Meets Justice<i>, </i>works on new evidence or overlooked avenues of investigation on cases where they believe there might have been a miscarriage of justice. An innocent person convicted for a crime they didn&#x2019;t commit.</p><p>I&#x2019;m busy but since the Costello case a few months back, nothing has broken my stride on the murder front. The Bureau for Serious Crime is doing its job. Set up three years ago to keep a focus on complex investigations in Ireland in a world where increasingly our law enforcement must look outwards, the aim of the Bureau is to remain a bastion of defense against our own criminals. Four districts of the garda�&#x2019;s finest detectives with a central hub in Dublin, run by me. We are a flexible, well-oiled machine that can step in where local resources are scant, or conversely handle those cases of national concern that feed the media. And the last few months have seen me on a roll. Three cases slapped down and filed away as if I&#x2019;d been working on a kids&#x2019; crossword.</p><p>I sigh. &#x201c;What do you need me for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It would help to have a detective chief superintendent on board. Even if not in an official capacity. We don&#x2019;t have anyone with your skill set. You&#x2019;re good at reading people, Frankie.&#x201d;</p><p>I look across the bar at Hennessy. I could make short work of this, run a few interviews, get to the real truth of why he thinks his conviction should be scrubbed out. I&#x2019;m curious as to what it is that has Tanya so worked up about his case. She knows I can&#x2019;t resist a puzzle. Even one I know already has an answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t about money?&#x201d; I check.</p><p>She flushes but keeps a lid on whatever emotion is behind her reaction. &#x201c;This is a big risk for us. With the media interest, if we come out looking like mugs, we&#x2019;ll not survive it. But if we&#x2019;re right, this will make us.&#x201d;</p><p>I watch Hennessy as he waits for the drinks. The barman reaches for glasses. He laughs at something Hennessy says, his thin shoulders shaking in response. And I can see how the public will be seduced by Hennessy if a documentary airs. He&#x2019;s not hard on the eyes. He appears kind. He seems normal. Like one of us. He wears his sheep&#x2019;s clothing with ease.</p><p>I think of the constant reports of serious crime that pass our desks daily and the careful designation of energy and money to each one. Even looking at Hennessy&#x2019;s case in the hours around my work, it would be hard to justify the time.</p><p>I hear the regret in my voice when I speak. &#x201c;Tanya, I&#x2019;m sorry but I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m the right person for this. The law served up the right sentence that day, and I don&#x2019;t believe society owes Se�n Hennessy one further moment of thought. From what I can remember, there was a crate-load of evidence, as well as witnesses.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But what if the evidence was wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tanya&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; She holds up a palm. &#x201c;Br�d and Cara Hennessy&#x2019;s blood was found beneath Se�n&#x2019;s fingernails and on his shirt. What if I told you that the first paramedic on the scene assessed both Br�d and Cara&#x201d;&#x2014;she counts off both of the victims on her fingers as she speaks&#x2014;&#x201c;but then treated Se�n for shock?&#x201d;</p><p>I sigh.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, Frankie. It&#x2019;s cross contamination. This was one of the major pieces of evidence submitted by the prosecution. What if there were more errors?&#x201d; She gives me an intense look and pulls the file back across the table. Opens it. &#x201c;Blackthorn Films. They&#x2019;ve won awards. This is going to be big. The charity can&#x2019;t pass it up. Yes, we need the funding, but more importantly, I believe him.&#x201d;</p><p>The memories I have of the Hennessy murders come drenched in an incongruous golden sunshine. It had been a scorcher of a summer. Heat drives up crime rates, with August being the time when families are most at risk of turning on one another. You could say that working on the force we were expecting something like it to happen but to be honest no one truly expects a person to murder his family. Even when you&#x2019;re standing over the bodies it&#x2019;s hard to believe.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I say to her.</p><p>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; she says quickly. &#x201c;I only want your opinion. We just need an objective voice. Your expertise in profiling, at compiling cases, would be invaluable to us.&#x201d; She slides the file across the table. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s documentary footage in the folder. One-on-one interviews with Se�n. Three hours of unedited material in total. I&#x2019;ll send it to your email too but you&#x2019;ll need the password to access it.&#x201d;</p><p>Hennessy returns to the table. &#x201c;Here you are.&#x201d; He places a glass of wine in front of Tanya then sits down, a pint of lager safe in his hands.</p><p>Somehow, I make myself speak to him. &#x201c;Why do you want to do this, Mr. Hennessy?&#x201d; I know the answer. Money. Always. But sometimes, with killers of this nature, it&#x2019;s simply attention. The narcissist can&#x2019;t resist indulging his own reflection.</p><p>He lifts the pint to his mouth, takes a drink. Blue eyes flash at me. Meek. The right touch of sadness and regret. Perfectly measured. &#x201c;My sister.&#x201d; He says it quiet, and I think there&#x2019;s some shame in him after all.</p><p>&#x201c;Your sister?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The way things are, I&#x2019;ll never see her again.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s probably for the best. Don&#x2019;t you think? Shouldn&#x2019;t she be allowed to live her life in peace? To move on?&#x201d;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a slight rise to his shoulders; the gray neck of his hoodie bunches. His hands stiffen round his drink. He looks down. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it does anyone any good to live a lie.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I doubt your sister believes she&#x2019;s living a lie. Out of everyone, she knows exactly what happened. She was there. And if she&#x2019;d wanted to contact you, she would have done so already, right?&#x201d;</p><p>He nods as if he was anticipating my response then says with a stubborn note of determination, &#x201c;If Cara doesn&#x2019;t want to see me, there&#x2019;s nothing I can do about that. But she should know the truth.&#x201d; A thick kind of anger closes round my neck. I feel it redden my face. I look to Tanya, but she&#x2019;s avoiding my eyes, her face a pale slate of neutrality.</p><p>&#x201c;She already knows the truth,&#x201d; I say. And the confidence stumbles on his face. &#x201c;Mr. Hennessy, I believe you slaughtered your parents and almost managed to kill your sister.&#x201d; He flinches but I continue. &#x201c;I believe justice has been served and its only fault is that you are free to sit here, across from me, and discuss how you can rescind that sentence.&#x201d;</p><p>He slides a hand over his face, squeezes his eyes with his fingertips. Tanya gives me a look that could work as a slap in the mouth but I want him to know whose side I&#x2019;m on. Always, victims first.</p><p>Finally he speaks. &#x201c;I get it. I was convicted. Now I&#x2019;m guilty until proven innocent.&#x201d; And when he looks at me again, there are tears watering in his eyes. &#x201c;But I swear to you, I didn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d; The last comes out between tight lips, an urgent rasping whisper.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a clatter of cutlery from behind the bar and I glance over in time to see the barman bend to collect whatever&#x2019;s fallen to the wooden floor. When he straightens, he wipes a knife on the cloth at his shoulder then resumes wrapping the cutlery in a paper napkin.</p><p>I turn to Tanya. The thin lines of her eyebrows are raised in an expression of hope and encouragement. I suspect she knows as well as I do what the answer will be. I sigh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll look at the footage. But that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great, Frankie.&#x201d; She smiles her enthusiasm.</p><p>Se�n nods and for a moment, it looks like he might grip my hands. His slide across the table but he stops halfway. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Tanya is already retrieving more documents from her bag.</p><p>More homework for me. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s a summary of our approach. We&#x2019;ve a new office in the city, off the quays.&#x201d; She places a business card in front of me. &#x201c;But it should be easy to touch base. As you know, I&#x2019;m doing most of my work from home.&#x201d;</p><p>Home translates into my parents&#x2019; house on Conquer Hill in Clontarf.

Even with the Green Bay Packers clinging to&nbsp;a slim chance for a playoff spot, his teammates and his adopted city didn&#x2019;t expect Brett to suit up. <br>&nbsp;<br>Big Irv <i>was</i> the game to Brett. As his coach at Hancock North Central High School in Kiln, Mississippi, Irv taught Brett the importance of execution, precision, and sacrifice. He rarely let Brett throw the ball; rather, he had him lead the run-oriented wishbone offense, which required him to handoff and then block for his teammates. When no major college had any interest in Brett as a quarterback, Irv got the University of Southern Mississippi to give him a shot as a defensive back. And when Brett did the impossible at Southern Miss&#x2013;moving from defense to the team&#x2019;s starting quarterback his freshman year&#x2013;Irv was there the whole way.<br>&nbsp;<br>Prior to the Raider game, Favre had started an exhausting 189 games straight (an NFL record) and was nursing a broken finger on his throwing hand since the early weeks of the 2003 season. Rumors of his retirement circulated among the press&#x2013;he was in his thirteenth year&#x2013;and while no one said it out loud, most commentators believed Brett was a shadow of his former self. <br> <br>But what happened in the Oakland twilight on December 22, 2003, is the stuff of NFL legend. Brett Favre sealed his reputation as one of the greatest football players in history.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play,&#x201d; he said after throwing for just under 400 hundred yards and four touchdowns to rout the Raiders. &#x201c;I love him so much, and I love this game. It meant a great deal to me, to my dad, and to my family, and I didn't expect this kind of performance. But I know he was watching.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>FAVRE is a dazzling tribute to the roller-coaster football life of Brett Favre, with personal family photos and remembrances, stunning four-color action shots, and inspiring stories of a lifelong love affair with the all-American game.</p><p><b>Chris Havel </b>is a sports columnist for the <i>Green Bay Press-Gazette</i> and has covered the Packers for fourteen years.

The stories also illuminate the common threads that connect us as human beings, the bridges we form one to the other despite conflict and misperceptions. We see an American experience, whether one is a recent immigrant or not, infused with migration, transience and displacement. The stories in this collection capture in a genuinely universal manner that sense of not belonging, of being "un-housed" in some way, and searching for a place in the world.</p></p><p>Yasser El-Sayed was a finalist for the Restless Books Prize for New Immigrant Writing, 2016, and his stories have been nominated for the Pushcart Prize and Best American Short Stories. He is a physician and professor at Stanford University where he specializes in high-risk obstetrics. He resides in Northern California.<p>"<em>The Alexandria You Are Losing</em> showcases a truly original voice and a brilliant imagination. Yasser El-Sayed captures with verve, surprise and insight what it is to be alive and human. Each story is a jewel, mounted by itself in a unique setting to capture its own light. But the common theme is an author who helps us connect to what is universal, to the mystery of being human and our ways of experiencing it. Ration your reading because this delicious repast ends too soon."</p><p>--Abraham Verghese, New York Times bestselling author of <em>Cutting for Stone</em></p><p>"With unflinching and poignant perception, El-Sayed captures the experience of living in a foreign place. Some who are displaced find adjustment difficult, family dynamics complicated and sometimes turbulent, are explored with subtlety and candor. The reader will not be left unsatisfied by the powerful stories in this collection. In a style reminiscent of Anton Chekhov, this is the right book at the right time."</p><p>--Julia Nunnally Duncan, author of <em>A Place That Was Home, </em> and <em>A Part of Me </em></p><p>"<em>The Alexandria You Are Losing </em>is a searing addition to the growing body of literature in English focusing on place, displacement, and the complicated relationships between characters with dual Eastern and Western connections and identities. A renowned doctor, El-Sayed tells stories with surgical precision, giving voice to feelings of loss and longing."</p><p>--Allen Mendenhall, editor of <em>Southern Literary Review</em></p><p>"<em>The Alexandria You are Losing</em> is a beautiful collection of moving stories, a report from exotic territory, full of vibrant detail and the atmosphere of memory, sometimes fraught, often moving, always fascinating. I read these stories with excitement and pleasure, not least because El-Sayed knows how to find the heart even when there's trouble just over the horizon."</p><p>--Bill Roorbach, author of <em>Life Among Giants, The Remedy for Love</em>, and <em>The Girl of the Lake.</em></p><p>"<em>The Alexandria You are Losing </em>is a gorgeous collection of stories alive with a common humanity that transcends their themes of cultural collision and drifting dislocation. Yasser El-Sayed's ability to channel voices from diverse geographies and backgrounds --from the decaying beauty of Alexandria, Egypt to the frigid grit of a Wisconsin winter-- is unique; he is shrewdly observant, but not judgmental, and blessed with a wicked sense of humor. The characters were so vivid and present I inhaled them, and I wanted to live in their stories."</p><p>--David Madsen, screenwriter of <em>Copycat</em></p><p>"You will carry these stories in your heart, as I do. Yasser El-Sayed's calm presence brings to us characters making lives in the chasm between traditional North African cultures and unrooted American lives. The stories illuminate cultural struggles cleanly and humanely, with great subtlety and nuance. If you have enjoyed the complex and resonant craft of a Raymond Carver, you will delight in these polished and brilliant stories."</p><p>--Clay Lewis, author of <em>Battlegrounds of Memory </em></p><p>"Beautifully poetic prose fill the pages of <em>The Alexandria You Are Losing</em> as lost souls search for home, for a place to belong... El-Sayed's characters drift without the anchor of home to moor them, yet their warmth and humanity as they stumble for footing draw you to them."</p><p>--Lara Bernhardt, author of <em>Shadow of the Taj</em><br> </p></p><h2>The New Antoinette Pope School Cookbook</h2><p>Is SIGNED by the author and is dated October 1973.</p><p></p><h2>Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100</h2><p><p>Imagine, if you can, the world in the year 2100.<br><br>In <em>Physics of the Future</em>, Michio Kaku&#x2014;the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Physics of the Impossible</em>&#x2014;gives us a stunning, provocative, and exhilarating vision of the coming century based on interviews with over three hundred of the world&#x2019;s top scientists who are already inventing the future in their labs. The result is the most authoritative and scientifically accurate description of the revolutionary developments taking place in medicine, computers, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, energy production, and astronautics.<br><br>In all likelihood, by 2100 we will control computers via tiny brain sensors and, like magicians, move objects around with the power of our minds. Artificial intelligence will be dispersed throughout the environment, and Internet-enabled contact lenses will allow us to access the world's information base or conjure up any image we desire in the blink of an eye.<br><br>Meanwhile, cars will drive themselves using GPS, and if room-temperature superconductors are discovered, vehicles will effortlessly fly on a cushion of air, coasting on powerful magnetic fields and ushering in the age of magnetism.<br><br>Using molecular medicine, scientists will be able to grow almost every organ of the body and cure genetic diseases. Millions of tiny DNA sensors and nanoparticles patrolling our blood cells will silently scan our bodies for the first sign of illness, while rapid advances in genetic research will enable us to slow down or maybe even reverse the aging process, allowing human life spans to increase dramatically.<br><br>In space, radically new ships&#x2014;needle-sized vessels using laser propulsion&#x2014;could replace the expensive chemical rockets of today and perhaps visit nearby stars.

That night, the newspapers printed a picture of his office, with an unfinished manuscript on his desk. The caption read that the greatest scientist of our era could not finish his greatest masterpiece. What, I asked myself, could be so difficult that such a great scientist could not finish it? What could possibly be that complicated and that important? To me, eventually this became more fascinating than any murder mystery, more intriguing than any adventure story. I had to know what was in that unfinished manuscript.<br><br> Later, I found out that the name of this scientist was Albert Einstein and the unfinished manuscript was to be his crowning achievement, his attempt to create a &#x201c;theory of everything,&#x201d; an equation, perhaps no more than one inch wide, that would unlock the secrets of the universe and perhaps allow him to &#x201c;read the mind of God.&#x201d;<br><br> But the other pivotal experience from my childhood was when I watched the Saturday morning TV shows, especially the <i>Flash Gordon</i> series with Buster Crabbe. Every week, my nose was glued to the TV screen. I was magically transported to a mysterious world of space aliens, starships, ray gun battles, underwater cities, and monsters. I was hooked. This was my first exposure to the world of the future. Ever since, I&#x2019;ve felt a childlike wonder when pondering the future.<br><br> But after watching every episode of the series, I began to realize that although Flash got all the accolades, it was the scientist Dr. Zarkov who actually made the series work. He invented the rocket ship, the invisibility shield, the power source for the city in the sky, etc. Without the scientist, there is no future. The handsome and the beautiful may earn the admiration of society, but all the wondrous inventions of the future are a by--product of the unsung, anonymous scientists.<br><br> Later, when I was in high school, I decided to follow in the footsteps of these great scientists and put some of my learning to the test. I wanted to be part of this great revolution that I knew would change the world. I decided to build an atom smasher. I asked my mother for permission to build a 2.3-million electron volt particle accelerator in the garage. She was a bit startled but gave me the okay. Then, I went to Westinghouse and Varian Associates, got 400 pounds of transformer steel, 22 miles of copper wire, and assembled a betatron accelerator in my mom&#x2019;s garage.<br><br> Previously, I had built a cloud chamber with a powerful magnetic field and photographed tracks of antimatter. But photographing antimatter was not enough. My goal now was to produce a beam of antimatter. The atom smasher&#x2019;s magnetic coils successfully produced a huge 10,000 gauss magnetic field (about 20,000 times the earth&#x2019;s magnetic field, which would in principle be enough to rip a hammer right out of your hand). The machine soaked up 6 kilowatts of power, draining all the electricity my house could provide. When I turned on the machine, I frequently blew out all the fuses in the house. (My poor mother must have wondered why she could not have a son who played football instead.)<br><br> So two passions have intrigued me my entire life: the desire to understand all the physical laws of the universe in a single coherent theory and the desire to see the future. Eventually, I realized that these two passions were actually complementary. The key to understanding the future is to grasp the fundamental laws of nature and then apply them to the inventions, machines, and therapies that will redefine our civilization far into the future.<br><br> There have been, I found out, numerous attempts to predict the future, many useful and insightful. However, they were mainly written by historians, sociologists, science fiction writers, and &#x201c;futurists,&#x201d; that is, outsiders who are predicting the world of science without a firsthand knowledge of the science itself. The scientists, the insiders who are actually creating the future in their laboratories, are too busy making breakthroughs to have time to write books about the future for the public.<br><br> That is why this book is different. I hope this book will give an insider&#x2019;s perspective on what miraculous discoveries await us and provide the most authentic, authoritative look into the world of 2100.<br><br> Of course, it is impossible to predict the future with complete accuracy. The best one can do, I feel, is to tap into the minds of the scientists at the cutting edge of research, who are doing the yeoman&#x2019;s work of inventing the future. They are the ones who are creating the devices, inventions, and therapies that will revolutionize civilization. And this book is their story. I have had the opportunity to sit in the front-row seat of this great revolution, having interviewed more than 300 of the world&#x2019;s top scientists, thinkers, and dreamers for national TV and radio. I have also taken TV crews into their laboratories to film the prototypes of the remarkable devices that will change our future. It has been a rare honor to have hosted numerous science specials for BBC--TV, the Discovery Channel, and the Science Channel, profiling the remarkable inventions and discoveries of the visionaries who are daring to create the future. Being free to pursue my work on string theory and to eavesdrop on the cutting--edge research that will revolutionize this century, I feel I have one of the most desirable jobs in science. It is my childhood dream come true.<br><br> But this book differs from my previous ones. In books like <i>Beyond Einstein, Hyperspace,</i> and <i>Parallel Worlds,</i> I discussed the fresh, revolutionary winds sweeping through my field, theoretical physics, that are opening up new ways to understand the universe. In <i>Physics of the Impossible,</i> I discussed how the latest discoveries in physics may eventually make possible even the most imaginative schemes of science fiction.<br><br> This book most closely resembles my book <i>Visions,</i> in which I discussed how science will evolve in the coming decades. I am gratified that many of the predictions made in that book are being realized today on schedule. The accuracy of my book, to a large degree, has depended on the wisdom and foresight of the many scientists I interviewed for it.<br><br> But this book takes a much more expansive view of the future, discussing the technologies that may mature in 100 years, that will ultimately determine the fate of humanity. How we negotiate the challenges and opportunities of the next 100 years will determine the ultimate trajectory of the human race.<br><br> <i><br><br></i><b>PREDICTING THE NEXT CENTURY</b> <br><br> Predicting the next few years, let alone a century into the future, is a daunting task. Yet it is one that challenges us to dream about technologies we believe will one day alter the fate of humanity.<br><br> In 1863, the great novelist Jules Verne undertook perhaps his most ambitious project. He wrote a prophetic novel, called <i>Paris in the Twentieth Century,</i> in which he applied the full power of his enormous talents to forecast the coming century. Unfortunately, the manuscript was lost in the mist of time, until his great--grandson accidentally stumbled upon it lying in a safe where it had been carefully locked away for almost 130 years. Realizing what a treasure he had found, he arranged to have it published in 1994, and it became a best seller.<br><br> Back in 1863, kings and emperors still ruled ancient empires, with impoverished peasants performing backbreaking work toiling in the fields. The United States was consumed by a ruinous civil war that would almost tear the country apart, and steam power was just beginning to revolutionize the world. But Verne predicted that Paris in 1960 would have glass skyscrapers, air conditioning, TV, elevators, high--speed trains, gasoline--powered automobiles, fax machines, and even something resembling the Internet. With uncanny accuracy, Verne depicted life in modern Paris.<br><br> This was not a fluke, because just a few years later he made another spectacular prediction. In 1865, he wrote <i>From the Earth to the Moon,</i> in which he predicted the details of the mission that sent our astronauts to the moon more than 100 years later in 1969. He accurately predicted the size of the space capsule to within a few percent, the location of the launch site in Florida not far from Cape Canaveral, the number of astronauts on the mission, the length of time the voyage would last, the weightlessness that the astronauts would experience, and the final splashdown in the ocean. (The only major mistake was that he used gunpowder, rather than rocket fuel, to take his astronauts to the moon. But liquid-fueled rockets wouldn&#x2019;t be invented for another seventy years.)<br><br> How was Jules Verne able to predict 100 years into the future with such breathtaking accuracy? His biographers have noted that, although Verne was not a scientist himself, he constantly sought out scientists, peppering them with questions about their visions of the future. He amassed a vast archive summarizing the great scientific discoveries of his time. Verne, more than others, realized that science was the engine shaking the foundations of civilization, propelling it into a new century with unexpected marvels and miracles. The key to Verne&#x2019;s vision and profound insights was his grasp of the power of science to revolutionize society.<br><br> Another great prophet of technology was Leonardo da Vinci, painter, thinker, and visionary. In the late 1400s, he drew beautiful, accurate diagrams of machines that would one day fill the skies: sketches of parachutes, helicopters, hang gliders, and even airplanes. Remarkably, many of his inventions would have flown. (His flying machines, however, needed one more ingredient: at least a 1-horsepower motor, something that would not be available for another 400 years.)<br><br> What is equally astonishing is that Leonardo sketched the blueprint for a mechanical adding machine, which was perhaps 150 years ahead of its time. In 1967, a misplaced manuscript was reanalyzed, revealing his idea for an adding machine with thirteen digital wheels. If one turned a crank, the gears inside turned in sequence performing the arithmetic calculations. (The machine was built in 1968 and it worked.)<br><br> In addition, in the 1950s another manuscript was uncovered which contained a sketch for a warrior automaton, wearing German--Italian armor, that could sit up and move its arms, neck, and jaw. It, too, was subsequently built and found to work.<br><br> Like Jules Verne, Leonardo was able to get profound insights into the future by consulting a handful of forward--thinking individuals of his time. He was part of a small circle of people who were at the forefront of innovation. In addition, Leonardo was always experimenting, building, and sketching models, a key attribute of anyone who wants to translate thinking into reality.<br><br> Given the enormous, prophetic insights of Verne and Leonardo da Vinci, we ask the question: Is it possible to predict the world of 2100? In the tradition of Verne and Leonardo, this book will closely examine the work of the leading scientists who are building prototypes of the technologies that will change our future. This book is not a work of fiction, a by--product of the overheated imagination of a Hollywood scriptwriter, but rather is based on the solid science being conducted in major laboratories around the world today.<br><br> The prototypes of all these technologies already exist. As William Gibson, the author of <i>Neuromancer</i> who coined the word <i>cyberspace,</i> once said, &#x201c;The future is already here. It&#x2019;s just unevenly distributed.&#x201d;<br><br> Predicting the world of 2100 is a daunting task, since we are in an era of profound scientific upheaval, in which the pace of discovery is always accelerating. More scientific knowledge has been accumulated just in the last few decades than in all human history. And by 2100, this scientific knowledge will again have doubled many times over.<br><br> But perhaps the best way to grasp the enormity of predicting 100 years into the future is to recall the world of 1900 and remember the lives our grandparents lived.<br><br> Journalist Mark Sullivan asks us to imagine someone reading a newspaper in the year 1900:<br><br> In his newspapers of January 1, 1900, the American found no such word as radio, for that was yet twenty years in from coming; nor &#x201c;movie,&#x201d; for that too was still mainly of the future; nor chauffeur, for the automobile was only just emerging and had been called &#x201c;horseless carriage. . . .&#x201d; There was no such word as aviator. . . . Farmers had not heard of tractors, nor bankers of the Federal Reserve System. Merchants had not heard of chain--stores nor &#x201c;self--service&#x201d;; nor seamen of oil--burning engines. . . . Ox--teams could still be seen on country roads. . . . Horses or mules for trucks were practically universal. . . . The blacksmith beneath the spreading chestnut--tree was a reality.<br><br> To understand the difficulty of predicting the next 100 years, we have to appreciate the difficulty that the people of 1900 had in predicting the world of 2000. In 1893, as part of the World&#x2019;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, seventy--four well--known individuals were asked to predict what life would be like in the next 100 years. The one problem was that they consistently underestimated the rate of progress of science. For example, many correctly predicted that we would one day have commercial transatlantic airships, but they thought that they would be balloons. Senator John J. Ingalls said, &#x201c;It will be as common for the citizen to call for his dirigible balloon as it now is for his buggy or his boots.&#x201d; They also consistently missed the coming of the automobile. Postmaster General John Wanamaker stated that the U.S. mail would be delivered by stagecoach and horseback, even 100 years into the future.<br><br> This underestimation of science and innovation even extended to the patent office. In 1899, Charles H. Duell, commissioner of the U.S. Office of Patents, said, &#x201c;Everything that can be invented has been invented.&#x201d;<br><br> Sometimes experts in their own field underestimated what was happening right beneath their noses. In 1927, Harry M. Warner, one of the founders of Warner Brothers, remarked during the era of silent movies, &#x201c;Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?&#x201d;<br><br> And Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, said in 1943, &#x201c;I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.&#x201d;<br><br> This underestimation of the power of scientific discovery even extended to the venerable <i>New York Times.</i> (In 1903, the <i>Times</i> declared that flying machines were a waste of time, just a week before the Wright brothers successfully flew their airplane at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In 1920, the <i>Times</i> criticized rocket scientist Robert Goddard, declaring his work nonsense because rockets cannot move in a vacuum. Forty--nine years later, when <i>Apollo 11</i> astronauts landed on the moon, the <i>Times,</i> to its credit, ran the retraction: ...</p><h2>The Architecture of John F.

Its trenchant and sensitive treatment of the subject will define our humanity for generations to come.</p><p><b>M. Scott Peck, M.D.</b>, is the author of several&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers, including&nbsp;<i>The Road Less Traveled</i>, which has spent more than ten years on the <i>Times</i> list. He and his wife, Lily, live in northern Connecticut and have been the recipients of several awards for peacemaking.The bestselling author of The Road Less Traveled offers a nuanced and thought-provoking contribution to a debate that, he believes, is going to make us face important questions about our direction as a society. Although assisted-suicide practitioner Dr. Jack Kevorkian gives Peck the shivers, our author credits him for having almost single-handedly made euthanasia a national issue in the US. Peck has not written about euthanasia before, and he does so now, he says, because of his alarm at the lack of passion, the ``vast, tacit approval of euthanasia,'' that has followed Kevorkian's activities. Peck's own position is a mixture of pragmatism and principle. He is not totally against assisted suicide in cases of severe and prolonged physical pain, but he believes that hospice, with its concept of palliative medical care and liberal use of morphine pumps, should make this option unnecessary. Of more practical concern for Peck is the use of euthanasia as a way of avoiding existential suffering in the face of death. Drawing on actual case histories of assisted suicide, he notes a tendency for the patient to want to remain in control. Peck argues that evading the process of gradual detachment at the approach of death is to succumb to the kind of fear that lies at the root of all neurosis. More radically, it is a denial of the soul and, as such, an expression of a deeply secular worldview. While Peck values secularism as an advance over religious bigotry, he suggests that it is a stage of limited personal growth. Peck is very careful to define his terms. As in all his books, he draws on his years of work as a therapist and on his personal struggles. Peck's open-ended and compassionate approach will speak to all shades of opinion.

But be careful---this is hazardous work. You&#39;re like lambs in a wolf pack. ---Luke 10:3, The Message It had been three wet, miserable days since John Wesley Powell and his team of nine adventurers had crashed through the 14 miles and 35 rapids that make up the section of the Colorado River known as Marble Canyon. Powell and his crew were well into their fourth month of a grueling and dangerous attempt to navigate the entire course of river through the Grand Canyon. It was a journey that began on May 24, 1869, when four boats under Powell&#39;s command--the Emma Dean, the Kitty Clyde&#39;s Sister, the Maid of the Canon, and the No Name---were launched at Green River Station, Wyoming Territory. The opening quotation above was written on the morning of August 13, 1869, as the expedition team was ready to descend into the roaring water that would lead them into the steepest depths of the Grand Canyon---a journey of amazing adventure, or death, or perhaps both. Perhaps it seems strange that these should be the opening words in the opening chapter of an introduction to a youth ministry text. We do not commonly think of the classroom as a place of adventure: &#39;The Quest for Calculus,&#39; &#39;Journeys in Biochemistry,&#39; &#39;Expeditions into Spanish Verbs.&#39; We are confronted in these opening paragraphs with words that might give pause to any reasonable person: words such as &#39;depths,&#39; &#39;dangerous,&#39; &#39;death,&#39; and, that scariest of all words for college students, &#39;morning.&#39; But it is good that we should begin here on the banks of a wild, beautiful, unpredictable river, because this book is about a launch into a grand adventure. Risk, as we have seen, is indispensable to any significant life, nowhere more clearly than in the life of the spirit. Dan Taylor, The Myth of Certainty The spiritual life cannot be made suburban. It is always frontier and we who live it must accept and even rejoice that it remains untamed. ---Howard Macey, quoted in Wild at Heart There are some very cautious, prudent, and entirely unadventurous 20-somethings who will never do anything wrong because they never do anything. Being an &#39;old maid&#39; in the following old poem is not a factor of gender; it is a factor of mindset: Here lie the bones of Nancy Jones. For her life held no terrors. She lived an old maid, She died an old maid, No hits, no runs, no errors. ---Anonymous Every great story involves a quest. In J. R. R. Tolkien&#39;s The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins ran from the door at a quarter til eleven without even so much as a pocket handkerchief and launched on an adventure that would change his life forever. Alice stepped through the looking glass into Wonderland; Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter stumbled through the wardrobe into Narnia.Abraham left &#39;his country, his people, and his father&#39;s household&#39; to follow the most outlandish sort of promise from a God he had only just met, and he never came back. Jacob and his sons went to Egypt for some groceries and four hundred years later the nation of Israel pulled up stakes and headed for home. Peter, Andrew, James, and John all turned on a dime one day to follow the Master, their fishing nets heaped in a wet pile.The Sacred Romance involves for every soul a journey of heroic proportions. And while it may require for some a change of geography, for every soul it means a journey of the heart. ---John Eldredge and Brent Curtis,The Sacred Romance (Nashville, Tenn.: Thomas Nelson, 1997), 143. A Great Adventure The language of the journey ---the quest, the adventure ---has long been the language of the Christian life. At the very heart of the Bible, in the Book of Psalms, we find no fewer than 15 chapters of what might be described as &#39;pilgrim songs&#39; or &#39;hiking songs,&#39; Psalms often referred to as Songs of Ascent.3 In reading through these 15 gritty and earthy psalms, Psalm 120 to Psalm 134, we come to understand why Eugene Peterson characterizes the Christian life as &#39;a long obedience in the same direction.&#39;4 Life is marked &#39;not so much by monuments as by footprints.&#39; It is a journey marked not by arrival, but by survival. The Christian life is about a quest, about pressing forward (Phil. 3:12--16, Col. 2:5, Heb. 12:1--3). It is about milestones, not tombstones. William Faulkner aptly sums up the idea this way: &#39;A monument only says, &#39;At least I got this far,&#39; while a footprint says, &#39;This is where I was when I moved again.&#39; So much of the drama of Scripture centers around journey, whether the study begins with that amazing call in Genesis, &#39;The Lord had said to Abram, &#39;Leave your country, your people and your father&#39;s household and go to the land I will show you&#39;&#39; (Gen. 12:1), or that dramatic night, terrible and wonderful, when God led his people out of Egypt on a journey we call the Exodus.

Set on the Mexican border and against the background of the US government&#39;s (via its agencies the CIA, FBI and DEA) underhand encouragement, sponsoring and active financing of the development of the drug cartels and their trade in Mexico, The Power of the Dog tells of the stories of a hugely varied cast of characters: a young Chicano boy from the barrio who makes good and becomes a Senator; a morally troubled DEA boss who tries to do good, but who is driven by events and by a desire both for salvation and revenge to sleep with the devil; the leaders of the drug gangs, some of them psychopathic, others urbane, civilised and deadly; a high-class prostitute; and a charismatic Catholic priest who is dedicated to the improvement of the lives of his people. Out of this material,Winslow has crafted a hugely ambitious - and hugely successful - novel that works on so many levels and offers so many satisfactions it defies belief.</p><p>Don Winslow has worked as a movie theatre manager, a production assistant, and as a private investigator. In addition to being an author, he now works as an independent consultant in issues involving litigation arising from criminal behaviour. His novels include The Death and Life of Bobby Z, and California Fire and Life.<i>Badiraguato District <br>State of Sinaloa <br>Mexico <br>1975</i><br><br>The poppies burn.<br><br>Red blossoms, red flames.<br><br>Only in hell, Art Keller thinks, do flowers bloom fire.<br><br>Art sits on a ridge above the burning valley. Looking down is like peering into a steaming soup bowl&#x2014;he can&#x2019;t see clearly through the smoke, but what he can make out is a scene from hell.<br><br>Hieronymus Bosch does the War on Drugs.<br><br>Campesinos&#x2014;Mexican peasant farmers&#x2014;trot in front of the flames, clutching the few possessions they could grab before the soldiers put the torch to their village. Pushing their children in front of them, the campesinos carry sacks of food, family photographs bought at great price, some blankets, some clothes. Their white shirts and straw hats&#x2014;stained yellow with sweat&#x2014;make them ghost-like in the haze of smoke.<br><br>Except for the clothes, Art thinks, it could be Vietnam.<br><br>He&#x2019;s half-surprised, glancing at the sleeve of his own shirt, to see blue denim instead of army green. Reminds himself that this isn&#x2019;t Operation Phoenix but Operation Condor, and these aren&#x2019;t the bamboo-thick mountains of I Corps, but the poppy-rich mountain valleys of Sinaloa.<br><br>And the crop isn&#x2019;t rice, it&#x2019;s opium.<br><br>Art hears the dull bass whop-whop-whop of helicopter rotors and looks up. Like a lot of guys who were in Vietnam, he finds the sound evocative. Yeah, but evocative of what? he asks himself, then decides that some memories are better left buried.<br><br>Choppers and fixed-wing planes circle overhead like vultures. The airplanes do the actual spraying; the choppers are there to help protect the planes from the sporadic AK-47 rounds fired by the remaining gomeros&#x2014;opium growers&#x2014;who still want to make a fight of it. Art knows too well that an accurate burst from an AK can bring down a chopper. Hit it in the tail rotor and it will spiral down like a broken toy at a kid&#x2019;s birthday party. Hit the pilot, and, well . . . So far they&#x2019;ve been lucky and no choppers have been hit. Either the gomeros are just bad shots, or they&#x2019;re not used to firing on helicopters.<br><br>Technically, all the aircraft are Mexican&#x2014;officially, Condor is a Mexican show, a joint operation between the Ninth Army Corps and the State of Sinaloa&#x2014;but the planes were bought and paid for by the DEA and are flown by DEA contract pilots, most of them former CIA employees from the old Southeast Asia crew. Now there&#x2019;s a tasty irony, Keller thinks&#x2014;Air America boys who once flew heroin for Thai warlords now spray defoliants on Mexican opium.<br><br>The DEA wanted to use Agent Orange, but the Mexicans had balked at that. So instead they are using a new compound, 24-D, which the Mexicans feel comfortable with, mostly, Keller chuckles, because the gomeros were already using it to kill the weeds around the poppy fields.<br><br>So there was a ready supply.<br><br>Yeah, Art thinks, it&#x2019;s a Mexican operation. We Americans are just down here as &#x201c;advisers.&#x201d;<br><br>Like Vietnam.<br><br>Just with different ball caps.<br><br>The American War on Drugs has opened a front in Mexico. Now ten thousand Mexican army troops are pushing through this valley near the town of Badiraguato, assisting squadrons of the Municipal Judicial Federal Police, better known as the federales, and a dozen or so DEA advisers like Art. Most of the soldiers are on foot; others are on horseback, like vaqueros driving cattle in front of them. Their orders are simple: Poison the poppy fields and burn the remnants, scatter the gomeros like dry leaves in a hurricane. Destroy the source of heroin here in the Sinaloan mountains of western Mexico.<br><br>The Sierra Occidental has the best combination of altitude, rainfall and soil acidity in the Western Hemisphere to grow Papaver somniferum, the poppy that produces the opium that is eventually converted to Mexican Mud, the cheap, brown, potent heroin that has been flooding the streets of American cities.<br><br>Operation Condor, Art thinks.<br><br>There hasn&#x2019;t been an actual condor seen in Mexican skies in over sixty years, longer in the States. But every operation has to have a name or we don&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s real, so Condor it is.<br><br>Art&#x2019;s done a little reading on the bird. It is (was) the largest bird of prey, although the term is a little misleading, as it preferred scavenging over hunting. A big condor, Art learned, could take out a small deer; but what it really liked was when something else killed the deer first so the bird could just swoop down and take it.<br><br>We prey on the dead.<br><br>Operation Condor.<br><br>Another Vietnam flashback.<br><br>Death from the Sky.<br><br>And here I am, crouched in the brush again, shivering in the damp mountain cold again, setting up ambushes.<br><br>Again.<br><br>Except the target now isn&#x2019;t some VC cadre on his way back to his village, but old Don Pedro �viles, the drug lord of Sinaloa, El Patr�n himself. Don Pedro&#x2019;s been running opium out of these mountains for half a century, even before Bugsy Siegel himself came here, with Virginia Hill in tow, to nail down a steady source of heroin for the West Coast Mafia.<br><br>Siegel made the deal with a young Don Pedro �viles, who used that leverage to make himself patr�n, the boss, a status he&#x2019;s maintained to this day. But the old man&#x2019;s power has been slipping a little lately as some young up-and-comers have started to challenge his authority. The law of nature, Art supposes&#x2014;the young lions eventually take on the old. Art has been kept awake more than one night in his Culiac�n hotel room by the sound of machine-gun fire in the streets, so common lately that the city has gained the nickname Little Chicago.<br><br>Well, after today, maybe they won&#x2019;t have anything to fight about.<br><br>Arrest old Don Pedro and you put an end to it.<br><br>And make yourself a star, he thinks, feeling a little guilty.<br><br>Art is a true believer in the War on Drugs. Growing up in San Diego&#x2019;s Barrio Logan, he saw firsthand what heroin does to a neighborhood, particularly a poor one. So this is supposed to be about getting drugs off the streets, he reminds himself, not advancing your career.<br><br>But the truth of it is that being the guy to bring down old Don Pedro �viles would make your career.<br><br>Which, truth be told, could use a boost.<br><br>The DEA is a new organization, barely three years old. When Richard Nixon declared a War on Drugs, he needed soldiers to fight it. Most of the new recruits came from the old Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs; a lot of them came from various police departments around the country, but not a few of the early start-up draft into the DEA came from the Company.<br><br>Art was one of these Company Cowboys.<br><br>That&#x2019;s what the police types call any of the guys who came in from the CIA. There&#x2019;s a lot of resentment and mistrust of the covert types by the law enforcement types.<br><br>Shouldn&#x2019;t be, Art thinks. It&#x2019;s basically the same function&#x2014;intelligence gathering. You find your assets, cultivate them, run them and act on the intelligence they give you. The big difference between his new work and his old work is that in the former you arrest your targets, and in the latter you just kill them.<br><br>Operation Phoenix, the programmed assassination of the Vietcong infrastructure.<br><br>Art hadn&#x2019;t done too much of the actual &#x201c;wet work.&#x201d; His job back in Vietnam was to collect raw data and analyze it. Other guys, mostly Special Forces on loan to the Company, went out and acted on Art&#x2019;s information.<br><br>They usually went out at night, Art recalls. Sometimes they&#x2019;d be gone for days, then reappear back at the base in the small hours of the morning, cranked up on Dexedrine. Then they&#x2019;d disappear into their hooches and sleep for days at a time, then go out and do it again.<br><br>Art had gone out with them only a few times, when his sources had produced info about a large group of cadres concentrated in the area. Then he&#x2019;d accompany the Special Forces guys to set up a night ambush.<br><br>He hadn&#x2019;t liked it much. Most of the time he was scared shitless, but he did his job, he pulled the trigger, he took his buddies&#x2019; backs, he got out alive with all his limbs attached and his mind intact. He saw a lot of shit he wishes he could forget.<br><br>I just have to live with the fact, Art thinks, that I wrote men&#x2019;s names down on paper and, in the act of doing so, signed their death warrants. After that, it&#x2019;s a matter of finding a way to live decently in an indecent world.<br><br>But that fucking war.<br><br>That goddamn motherfucking war.<br><br>Like a lot of people, he watched the last helicopters taking off from Saigon rooftops on television. Like a lot of vets, he went out and got good and stinking drunk that night, and when the offer came to move over to the new DEA, he jumped at it.<br><br>He talked it over with Althie first.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe this is a war worth fighting,&#x201d; he told his wife. &#x201c;Maybe this is a war we can actually win.&#x201d;<br><br>And now, Art thinks as he sits and waits for Don Pedro to show up, we might be close to doing it.<br><br>His legs ache from sitting still but he doesn&#x2019;t move. His stint in Vietnam taught him that. The Mexicans spaced in the brush around him are likewise disciplined&#x2014;twenty special agents from the DFS, armed with Uzis, dressed in camouflage.<br><br>T�o Barrera is wearing a suit.<br><br>Even up here in the high brush, the governor&#x2019;s special assistant is wearing his trademark black suit, white button-down shirt, skinny black tie. He looks comfortable and serene, the image of Latino male dignity.<br><br>He reminds you of one of those matinee idols from an old &#x2019;40s movie, Art thinks. Black hair slicked back, pencil mustache, thin, handsome face with cheekbones that look like they&#x2019;re cut from granite.<br><br>Eyes as black as a moonless night.<br><br>Officially, Miguel �ngel Barrera is a cop, a Sinaloa state policeman, the bodyguard to the state governor, Manuel S�nchez Cerro. Unofficially, Barrera is a fixer, the governor&#x2019;s point man. And seeing how Condor is technically a Sinaloa state operation, Barrera is the guy who&#x2019;s really running the show.<br><br>And me, Art thinks. If I really want to be honest about it, T�o Barrera is running me.<br><br> The twelve weeks of DEA training weren&#x2019;t that hard. The PT was a breeze&#x2014;Art could easily run the three-mile course and play basketball, and the self-defense component was unsophisticated compared with Langley. The instructors just had them wrestle and box, and Art had finished third in the San Diego Golden Gloves as a kid.<br><br>He was a mediocre middleweight with good technique but slow hands. He found out the hard truth that you can&#x2019;t learn speed. He was just good enough to get into the upper ranks, where he could really get beat up. But he showed he could take it, and that was his ticket as a mixed-race kid in the barrio. Mexican fight fans have more respect for what a fighter can take than for what he can dish out.<br><br>And Art could take it.<br><br>After he started boxing, the Mexican kids pretty much left him alone. Even the gangs backed off him.<br><br>In the DEA training sessions he made it a point to take it easy on his opponents in the ring, though. There was no point in beating someone up and making an enemy just to show off.<br><br>The law enforcement&#x2013;procedure classes were tougher, but he got through them all right, and the drug training was pretty easy, questions like, Can you identify marijuana? Can you identify heroin? Art resisted the impulse to answer that he always could at home.<br><br>The other temptation he resisted was to finish first in his class. He could have, knew he could have, but decided to fly under the radar. The law enforcement guys already felt that the Company types were trespassing on their turf, so it was better to walk lightly.<br><br>So he took it a little easy in the physical training, kept quiet in class, punted a few questions on the tests. He did enough to do well, to pass, but not enough to shine. It was a little harder to be cool in the field training. Surveillance practice? Old hat. Hidden cameras, mikes, bugs? He could install them in his sleep. Clandestine meetings, dead drops, live drops, cultivating a source, interrogating a suspect, gathering intelligence, analyzing data? He could have taught the course.<br><br>He kept his mouth shut, graduated, and was declared a Special Agent of the DEA. They gave him a two-week vacation and sent him straight to Mexico.<br><br>Right to Culiac�n.<br><br>The capital of the Western Hemisphere drug trade.<br><br>Opium&#x2019;s market town.<br><br>The belly of the beast.<br><br>His new boss gave him a friendly greeting. Tim Taylor, the Culiac�n RAC (Resident Agent in Charge) had already perused Art&#x2019;s shield and seen through the transparent screen. He didn&#x2019;t even look up from the file. Art was sitting across from his desk and the guy said, &#x201c;Vietnam?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Accelerated Pacification Program&#x2019; . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d; Accelerated Pacification Program, aka Operation Phoenix. The old joke being that a lot of guys got peaceful in a hurry.<br><br>&#x201c;CIA,&#x201d; Taylor said, and it wasn&#x2019;t a question, it was a statement.<br><br>Question or statement, Art didn&#x2019;t answer it. He knew the book on Taylor&#x2014;he was an old BNDD guy who&#x2019;d lived through the low-budget bad days. Now that drugs were a fat priority, he didn&#x2019;t intend to lose his hard-earned gains to a bunch of new kids on the block.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The Time Machine (Great Illustrated Classics)</h2><p>The distant future, 710,802 A.D.

Since the arrival of Columbus, Native Americans have endured countless hardships. Like all of New England&#39;s indigenous people, western Connecticut&#39;s Paugussett tribe has suffered injustice and fought determinedly to preserve their cultural identity. In A History of Connecticut&#39;s Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe, author Charles Brilvitch passionately chronicles the tribe&#39;s struggles and fascinating history through the Victorian era to the present, and traces their traditions and ongoing determination to preserve an irreplaceable and vanishing culture.</p><p>Author Charles W. Brilvitch, a graduate of Case Western Reserve University, has spent decades researching and writing on the southwestern Connecticut coast, especially the Bridgeport environs. Retained by Bridgeport&#39;s Paugussett Tribe as an official tribal historian, Brilvitch has previously published several titles on the Bridgeport region, including Walking Through History (Seaports of Black Rock and Southport) and Lithograph Views of Bridgeport 1860. Prior to his work for the Paugussett Tribe, Brilvitch held a variety of positions for the city of Bridgeport, having been a housing agency director, city environmental officer, and official city historian.</p><h2>Termination and Relocation: Federal Indian Policy, 1945-1960</h2><p><p>Between the end of the Roosevelt era and the beginning of the Kennedy administration, less traditional Native Americans, congressional leaders, and government administrators developed a policy that they hoped would integrate the Indian population with mainstream America. To this end, they enacted laws to terminate the government's trusteeship of Indian lands and relocate Indians to the nation's cities. They believed that once Indians left the reservation, they would have opportunities for education and employment that would enable them to participate more fully in the larger society. These policies were most fully applied to the Menominee and Klamath tribes.</p><p>But the sponsors of this legislation underestimated the importance of the fundamental differences between Indian and Anglo culture that would make it nearly impossible for most Indians to make the transition. By the early 1960s it had become tragically apparent that the policies of termination and relocation were creating a new subclass of urban poor: Indians who were ill equipped to survive in the competitive, materialistic world off the reservation.</p><p>In this major study Fixico looks at the history and effects of these policies from the Indian perspective. He also situates termination within the larger issue of civil rights during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations.</p></p><p>A major study of the effects on American Indians of the termination and relocation policies instituted during the Truman and Eisenhower era.Donald L.

Matching wits with this cunningly twisted opponent will require all of Charlie&#x2019;s training and expert skills. But even with her devilish &#x201c;guardian angel&#x201d;&#x2014;not to mention her favorite flesh-and-blood Fed, Tony Bartoli&#x2014;watching her beautiful back, the Gingerbread Man&#x2019;s horrifying grin might be the last thing Charlie ever sees.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Last Kiss Goodbye</i></b><br>&nbsp; <br>"Top-notch . . .

The mother of three boys, she lives in her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.<p>Chapter One</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sight of the dead man stretched out on her couch stopped Dr.&nbsp;Charlotte Stone in her tracks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Except for the flickering glow of the TV, the house was dark, but his big body sprawled across the pale natural linen upholstery was impossible to miss. Freezing in place just inside the threshold of her living room, Charlie fought desperately to get a grip. Lying on his back with his head resting on one of the couch&#x2019;s thickly padded arms, eyes closed and arms folded across his wide chest, he could almost have been asleep. But she knew better: he was beyond sleep now. The sudden tightness in her chest as she looked at him made it difficult to breathe. Her heart pounded. Her pulse raced.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She was swallowing hard, working on corralling her runaway emotions and whipping them into some kind of acceptable shape, when he opened his eyes and looked at her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even seen by TV light, those sky blue eyes of his were enough to make an unsuspecting woman go weak at the knees. Luckily, she had experienced their power before. Plus, she knew what he was, what he was capable of. But the sad fact was, she was a sucker for him anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He smiled at her. It wasn&#x2019;t a particularly nice smile. Didn&#x2019;t matter: her stomach still fluttered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Idiot.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So how&#x2019;s that whole moving on thing working out for you, Doc?&#x201d; he drawled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The hint of acidity in Michael Garland&#x2019;s honey--dipped voice didn&#x2019;t stop the warm rush of&#x2014;-let&#x2019;s call it relief&#x2014;-that had started flooding her veins the second she&#x2019;d laid eyes on him. She absolutely should not have been so glad to see him. In fact, she should not have been glad to see him at all. But where he and she were concerned, &#x201c;should&#x201d; had flown out the window a while back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; Charlie&#x2019;s answer was as cool and untroubled as she <i>wasn&#x2019;t</i> feeling. Regaining her power of movement, she hit the wall switch that turned on the lamps on either side of the couch. Then she walked across the polished wood floor to the bleached oak coffee table, picked up the remote, and turned the TV off, ending the deafening blast of the sports channel he had been watching. Cranked to an almost painful loudness, the sound was what had brought Charlie rushing in from the porch a couple of moments before&#x2014;-and what had broken up the more than friendly good--night that she&#x2019;d been exchanging at her front door with Tony Bartoli, the handsome FBI agent whom Garland thought she was moving on to. Garland had clearly seen her kissing Tony, and he just as clearly hadn&#x2019;t liked it. What his jibe meant was that he thought that she was moving on to Tony from <i>him.</i> Not that she and Garland had the kind of relationship that she could move on from, exactly, but&#x2014;-well, it was complicated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The short version was, she was a psychiatrist who studied serial killers. Garland was a convicted serial killer, and, as an inmate at Wallens Ridge State Prison, where she was conducting her latest government--sponsored study, her former research subject. That association had ended with his death.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was the part that bore repeating: Michael Garland was absolutely, positively, no--coming--back--from--it dead. As in, what she was looking at and talking to was his ghost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>See, she had the unfortunate ability to see ghosts. Oh, not all ghosts. Only the recently, violently departed, who, confused about what had happened to them, sometimes lingered for a short period on earth after their passing. Garland had been murdered eleven days before, shanked by one of his fellow inmates. Charlie had tried to save his life, to no avail. In classic no--good--deed--goes--unpunished style, his ghost had attached itself to her at the moment of his passing, to torment and harass (among other things) her until he should finally pass on to the Great Beyond.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which, in typically irritating fashion, he was resisting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Usually the ghosts she could see lingered for no more than a week. By that yardstick, Garland was already well past his sell--by date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which was one reason she had been so glad&#x2014;-strike that&#x2014;-so surprised to see him. She had last set eyes on him some four days before, when he had saved her life. Since then, she had been afraid&#x2014;-strike that, too&#x2014;-increasingly convinced that she would never see him again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Much as she hated to admit it even to herself, the thought had made her heart bleed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But here he was, all six--foot--three hunky inches of him. Thirty--six years old at the time of his death. Chippendales--worthy body in a snug white T-shirt and faded jeans. A thick mane of tawny hair that didn&#x2019;t quite reach his wide shoulders. Square jaw, broad cheekbones and forehead, straight nose and well--cut mouth. Absurdly tan and healthy--looking for a ghost&#x2014;-or a man who had spent the last four years of his life in federal prison, which he had done. Outrageously handsome. Certifiably dangerous. The proverbial bad penny.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Who could make her heart pound and her blood heat and her good sense fly out the window. He was the very last thing she needed&#x2014;or wanted&#x2014;-in her life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dead or alive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not that she had any choice in the matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She could no more control his presence in her life than she could control the sun, the moon, and the stars. He had just shown up, and one day&#x2014;-probably sooner rather than later&#x2014;-he would disappear. The universe was in charge here, not her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The thought steadied her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Where have you been?&#x201d; If there was a snap in her tone, he had earned it, simply because he had somehow managed to make her care about the answer. Still, afraid her question might reveal how stupidly involved with him she had become, she would have taken it back if she could have.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Missed me bad, hmm?&#x201d; Garland swung his long legs off the couch and sat up. Under other circumstances, Charlie would have given a dirty look to the scuffed cowboy boots that he hadn&#x2019;t seemed to have any qualms about planting on her pristine couch. But ghost boots&#x2014;-she was pretty sure that they didn&#x2019;t leave marks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, the smirk in the grin he directed at her was way more annoying than the boots on the linen, so she directed her dirty look right into his twinkling baby blues before turning on her heel and walking away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d; She hadn&#x2019;t missed him one bit, she told herself. She threw the reply over her shoulder as she reached the hall and headed toward the kitchen, past the old--fashioned staircase that led to the second floor. Standing up, he followed her. She was wearing nothing more exciting than a silky white sleeveless blouse and a pair of well--tailored black slacks with heels, a little dressier than her usual attire because Tony had been taking her out to dinner but nothing special. Still, she could feel Garland&#x2019;s eyes on her, and strongly suspected that he was watching her trim backside with appreciation as she walked. Casting a quick, suspicious glance over her shoulder, she tried to catch him at it, but he was (a) too quick, (b) too wily, or (c) just too damned lucky to get caught. As their eyes met, he grinned at her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Liar,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She snorted, shaking her head in firm denial. Terrifying to think that having a ghost following her made her feel more fully alive than she had in days. Even more terrifying to realize that what she really wanted to do was turn around and walk right into his arms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which she couldn&#x2019;t do, because he had no more substance than air. And which she wouldn&#x2019;t do even if she could.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because she truly wasn&#x2019;t that self--destructive. She didn&#x2019;t think.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Moonlight pouring through the kitchen windows&#x2014;-a tall, wide one that took up almost all the back wall behind the eating area, and a smaller one set into the top of the kitchen door&#x2014;-illuminated the white cabinets and stainless steel appliances and hardwood floor. She&#x2019;d left the curtains in the front of the house closed, so no one could see in from the street. The kitchen blinds were raised all the way to the top of the windows, because there was no one living behind her to see in, and because she liked the view. As she stepped from the hall&#x2019;s gloom into the silvery light, Charlie saw her reflection in the big window&#x2019;s dark glass. Her chestnut brown hair hung in loose waves around her shoulders. Her fair skin was, as usual, pale, but her denim blue eyes looked kind of sultry because she had deliberately played them up with liner and shadow, which she almost never wore, and an extra coat or two of mascara. Her wide mouth looked full and soft, but more vulnerable than it should have, given that right after dinner she had freshly applied deep red (vampy) lipstick. That softly smudged look would be because, she realized belatedly, Tony had subsequently kissed all her lipstick off, so her lips were now both slightly swollen and bare. She was five--six, slender and fit at age thirty--two, and over the years a lot of guys had told her that she was beautiful. If she remained skeptical, it was because most of the time those same guys had been trying to talk her into the sack. Tonight, the makeup plus the three--inch heels made her look, um, sexier. Ordinarily she wore low--heeled, sensible shoes because the last thing she wanted to do was give off any kind of look--at--me--I&#x2019;m-hot vibe. This almost daily exercise in discretion owed a lot to the fact that her usual work was carried out in a prison full of incarcerated men. Which was also why she customarily wore her hair up and minimal makeup. But tonight, for Tony, she&#x2019;d made an effort. With, yes, the thought that she might allow their relationship to pro-gress to the next level, as in, sleep with him. Because Tony was way handsome and because she really liked him and because she badly needed a normal, uncomplicated man--woman relationship in her life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And because she&#x2019;d feared&#x2014;-thought&#x2014;-that Garland was gone for good and she was determined to eradicate any lingering memories of him. Of <i>them</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, she hadn&#x2019;t been able to bring herself to invite Tony in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She&#x2019;d already been sending him on his way when the blasting of her should--have--been--silent TV had reached her ears and caused her heart to swell with hope and hurried things along. Sex with Tony, she had decided somewhere between dinner and her front door, was something that just wasn&#x2019;t going to happen. At least, not yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Garland didn&#x2019;t have to know that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, she wasn&#x2019;t about to let Garland know that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was way too full of himself already.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charlie suddenly realized that hers was the only reflection that she saw in the window, although Garland was right behind her. A lightning glance over her shoulder confirmed it: he was still there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But to judge by what she could see in the window, she was alone. His reflection didn&#x2019;t show up. And that would be because, in the physical world in which she and every other living creature existed, he did not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Only she could see him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Admit it, Doc: you were worried about me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charlie closed her eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Worried about him.</i> That vastly understated the case. Truth was, when he had not shown back up after materializing for just long enough to take the killing blow meant for her, she had been sick with fear over him. Afraid that he had been sucked up into Eternity, and that she would never see him again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The pain that had accompanied that fear had shown her how very vulnerable she had become where he was concerned. Now that he was back, she was determined to better guard her clearly way--too--susceptible heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Falling in love with him was not an option. In life he&#x2019;d been the baddest of bad men, the convicted murderer of seven women, sentenced to death for horrible, brutal crimes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And as sexy and charming as he might be, he was the exact same person in death.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That&#x2019;s what she had to keep reminding herself of, even if some too--stupid--to--live part of her refused to accept it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He claimed he was innocent. All the evidence said other-wise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even if, for the sake of argument, she allowed herself to believe in his innocence, believe that the exhaustive police investigation and all the evidence and the courts and the entire criminal justice system were plain wrong in his case, she still wasn&#x2019;t about to let herself go where she feared their association was headed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t about to commit the ultimate folly of letting herself fall in love with him. No way, no how.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bottom line was, he was dead, she was alive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever their relationship was or wasn&#x2019;t, the hard truth was, there was absolutely no future in it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If she let herself forget that, she deserved every bit of heartbreak that would be hurtling her way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>So get over being so ridiculously glad to see him already</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Charlie opened her eyes. There she still was, looking at her own reflection in the kitchen window, with not so much as a glimmer to indicate that a gorgeous (dead) guy was standing right behind her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I was actually very comfortable with the idea that nature had finally taken its course with you.&#x201d; She spoke over her shoulder, admirably cool, as she crossed to the light switch beside the back door and flipped on the kitchen light. A round oak table with four slat--back chairs stood in the eating area in front of the window. Because she had been away, the table was piled high with mail. Beyond it, out the window, she could see the tall, nodding shadows of the sunflowers that grew in a patch along her back fence. Backlit by moonlight, they were striping the grass with shifting lines of black. Beyond that, a thickly wooded mountainside formed an impenetrable wall of darkness as it rose to meet the night sky.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This old--fashioned, two--story white clapboard farmhouse with its gingerbread trim and wide front porch was the first real home she had ever had, and she loved it. Located on a quiet street at the edge of Big Stone Gap, Virginia, a coal mining town deep in the heart of Appalachia that was still reeling from the recession, it provided her with a much--needed respite from the daily grimness of her work at the prison, which perched like a vulture at the top of the mountain, overlooking the town. Decorating and furnishing the house had been a project that she had enjoyed.</p></p><h2>The New American Heart Association Cookbook, 8th Edition</h2><p>In print for more than thirty-five years and with three million copies sold, <i>The New American Heart Association Cookbook</i> remains <i>the</i> ultimate resource on achieving a healthy diet.

His vast influence reaches through all modern occultism. He is widely recognized as the first Western investigator to give initiation a truly scientific method. In reconciling occultism to physical science, mathematics and philosophy, Crowley achieved a lasting synthesis that remains unsurpassed for depth of insight and comprehensiveness.</p><h2>McDuff Goes to School</h2><p>When McDuff and his new French-speaking neighbors&#39; dog--a spunky Scottie named Marie-Antoinette--are enrolled in obedience school, it seems as though McDuff has not learned his lessons. 100,000 first printing.</p><p>reS-Gr 2-The determined, bright, and adorable West Highland terrier is back as he welcomes new neighbors and a new language. McDuff's strong-willed nature places him in obedience school, where he has the potential to earn a blue ribbon at graduation. While the dog finds his family too busy to practice, he listens attentively to the routines of his Scottie friend Marie-Antoinette and her French owners; to his family's surprise, he has learned the commands in another language. The French phrases may prove difficult for the pup's youngest fans, but the endearing illustrations of canine faces and exuberant paws in action transcend any additional need for explanation. Jeffers's art perfectly complements Wells's simple text and captures an earlier era, seemingly the '30s, with perspectives that emphasize the dogs that play an important role in their owners' lives. A short illustrated glossary and pronunciation guide to the obedience commands are included.<p></p><p><i>Mary Elam, Forman Elementary School, Plano, TX</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Ages 2-5. The powerhouse team of Wells and Jeffers reunite for their fifth McDuff collaboration, packing plenty of sweetness and humor into a simple dog story. Jeffers' illustrations catch the look of a 1940s English village that suits the comfortable feel of the tale. Terrier McDuff meets his new neighbor, a French terrier named Marie Antoinette, who responds "Ouf" to McDuff's "Woof." After McDuff acts up at the new neighbors' house, he's sent to obedience school, and Marie Antoinette goes along. Children will be so engaged by the dogs' antics that they'll hardly notice the many French words they're picking up. A glossary of French terms is appended. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Devine's <i>The Scottish Nation, 1700-2007</i>:<br>"One of the most significant Scottish books of the century." <i>--The Herald<br><br></i><b>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY<br><br></b>In this follow-up to The Scottish Nation: 1700&#x2013;2007, University of Edinburgh history professor Devine casts his net more widely to describe Scottish emigration throughout the world. A poor land in the 18th century, Scotland lagged behind England's Industrial Revolution. By 1850 it had caught up, but Scots continued to leave in record numbers. They made an early, bad impression in revolutionary America because most were loyalists, but this was soon replaced by the ongoing stereotype of the thrifty, superachieving Scotsman. There was no shortage of failure and bad behavior, but Devine admits that, wherever they settled, Scots were overrepresented among business, education, military leadership, and missionary work. He explores the source of that success in chapters on Scottish demographics, religion, and economics, devoting as much space to his nation's culture as its emigrants. Although not an academic study, the book contains more statistics, tables, and critical arguments than the average history buff would want, but readers willing to skim will enjoy an enlightening experience. 10 maps. (Oct.)<br><br><b>LIBRARY JOURNAL<br></b><br>Devine (Sir William Fraser Professor of Scottish History &amp; Palaeography, Univ. of Edinburgh; The Scottish Nation, 1700 2007) rounds out his trilogy of authoritative works on Scottish history with this seminal volume on the dispersion of the Scots to other lands throughout history. Devine insightfully addresses the impetus behind the large-scale Scottish emigration as well as the experiences of �migr�s in their new lands over the past 250 years. Covering Scottish engagement in the colonial slave and tobacco trades; the movement of impoverished Highland Scots during famine in the 1850s; fortune-seeking Scots in the British Empire and the American colonies; and Scottish missionary efforts in India and Africa, Devine offers a sweeping critical examination of this topic, which he admits is in its infancy as an area of academic study. He succeeds in addressing a broad span of time and geography while avoiding both triumphalism and exceptionalism on behalf of the Scots. VERDICT A meticulously researched and thoroughly documented academic volume that will be welcomed by scholars and others with a keen interest in Scottish history.&#x2014;Elizabeth L. Winter, Georgia Inst. of Technology Lib., Atlanta <br><br><b>CHOICE<br></b><br>Devine (Univ. of Edinburgh, Scotland) concludes his masterful trilogy of Scottish history, following his critically acclaimed <i>The Scottish Nation, 1700-2000</i> (1999) and <i>Scotland's Empire, 1600-1815</i> (CH, Apr'05, 42-4853) with this volume that tells the tale of the thousands of Scots who migrated throughout the British Empire. Devine delves behind the myths and notions of nationalistic pride while examining the distinctive contribution of Scots to the development of the British Empire from North America to the smallest Caribbean islands. The author pays particular attention to the role of Scottish traders, missionaries, and soldiers who were greatly overrepresented as a percentage of the population throughout the British Empire. Equally of interest is Devine's examination of the impact of the Scottish diaspora and newly globalizing economy of Scotland itself, deftly illustrating the two-way nature of the linkages and import of the overseas Scots to the development of Scotland. The author's broad grasp and meticulous research of the topic has produced another first-rate book that cements his reputation as the preeminent historian in the field of modern Scottish history. <b>Summing Up:</b> Highly recommended. Most levels/libraries.&nbsp;--&nbsp;<i>S. M. McDonald, Bentley University<br></i><br><b>THE ECONOMIST<br></b><p>Two years ago more than 47,000 people from all over the world journeyed to Scotland to celebrate their Caledonian lineage in an event called the &#x201c;Homecoming&#x201d;. Many of them had only recently discovered an interest in their origins and some, it seems safe to say, held peculiar ideas about where their forebears had come from and what impelled them to leave. Many people of Scottish descent, especially in America, assume that their ancestors hailed from the Highlands; that having been dispossessed of their land, they were forcibly driven into exile; and that after the Jacobites&#x2019; defeat at the battle of Culloden in 1746, if not before, these brave, egalitarian and freedom-loving people were victims of the oppressive English.</p><p>The truth is more complicated than that, as T.M. Devine, a professor of history at the University of Edinburgh, is at pains to show. The Scots have been emigrants and adventurers since at least the 13th century. At first most went to northern Europe as mercenary soldiers or traders, setting up commercial networks from Rotterdam to K�nigsberg and penetrating far into Poland. Later they settled in large numbers in Ulster. By the beginning of the 18th century life expectancy was rising among landed Scots but second and third sons had little hope of becoming farmers.</p><p>For many of these, the Act of Union with England in 1707 came as a blessing. It opened to Scottish merchants the protected markets of the English colonies and provided countless jobs for soldiers, contractors and bureaucrats in an expanding empire. For Presbyterians, the union also had the political advantage of providing a defence against the possibility of an unwelcome Catholic Stuart restoration.</p><p>Scots, already well established in the Caribbean, were soon all over British North America and, through the East India Company, much of Asia. Scots were prominent in trading firms like Jardine Matheson and the North West Company; in 1799, 78% of the overseas employees of the Hudson&#x2019;s Bay Company, whose domain encompassed more than 10% of the Earth&#x2019;s land surface, came from the islands of Orkney alone. Scottish emigrants flourished not only throughout the empire but also in England, other parts of Europe, and even South America and Japan.</p><p>Many of those who stayed at home also prospered. By the 1770s Glasgow had secured most of the British tobacco trade. It later became a centre for sugar, engineering and shipbuilding. All over the country fortunes were being made in textiles or related products. In Dundee the product was jute, in Paisley it was thread, in Kirkcaldy carpets. Scotland also became a leader in railways, chemicals, locomotives and then finance. No wonder that by the 1850s it was one of the most urbanised and industrialised countries in the world.</p><p>Why then did it send so many of its citizens abroad? The answer varies according to time and place of origin. Emigrants came from all over the country. Some, particularly in the Highlands and islands, were certainly poor, even destitute, and the clearances in the late 1840s and early 1850s were undeniably brutal and often coercive. Most of those who left, however, were not utterly impoverished; many had skills and qualifications. Some were driven by martial spirit, missionary zeal or imperial fervour. The empire, Mr Devine points out, was an emphatically British venture in which the Scots saw themselves as equal partners with the English, giving them self-respect as well as prosperity.</p><p>The main motive, though, was the desire for a better life and more opportunities. In this, and in their readiness to work hard, Scots were much like emigrants elsewhere. Similarly, like other emigrants, they persecuted native Americans, exterminated aborigines, stole land, defrauded their partners, exploited their workers and happily traded in opium. They did not trade in slaves, not much anyway. But Scotland&#x2019;s economy in the 18th century was inextricably intertwined with slavery through the sugar, tobacco and cotton industries, plus the civil and military structures that sustained them. Scots were pretty average in other ways, too. They made bad investments, could be thoroughly prejudiced (often about each other) and, it should be remembered, frequently returned home as failures (over 40% in the 1890s).</p><p>Yet in some ways they were untypical. They were often educated, which helped to account for the high numbers of lawyers, doctors and engineers among them. This in turn may explain why they were so influential in the lands where they settled. They were also militaristic, religious (David Livingstone, still revered in Africa, became a Victorian saint), loyal (notably to the Crown in the American colonies) and liberal (reflecting the Scottish Enlightenment). Above all, they were numerous, at times proportionately more so than any European nation except the Irish and perhaps the Norwegians.</p><p>Mr Devine explains all this with a masterly breadth of knowledge and an admirable absence of hyperbole. Unfortunately, his editors do not match his skills. The inclusion of so much analysis of Scottish topics and Scotland&#x2019;s engagement with the world shortchanges those expecting a comprehensive book about the emigrants themselves. Moreover, the reader may weary of so many repetitive statistics. Most could have been incorporated in a single chart or map showing how many Scots left when, where they came from and where they went. All these blemishes, however, count as little compared with the work&#x2019;s great virtue of helping to rescue Scottish history from the romanticised, self-pitying, tartan tosh that has captured the popular imagination of so many Scots both at home and abroad.</p></p><h2>American Patriot: The Life and Wars of Colonel Bud Day</h2><p>During the course of his military career, Bud Day won every available combat medal, escaped death on no less than seven occasions, and spent 67 months as a POW in the infamous Hanoi Hilton, along with John McCain. Despite sustained torture, Day would not break. He became a hero to POWs everywhere--a man who fought without pause, not a prisoner of war, but a prisoner at war.<br> Upon his return, passed over for promotion to Brigadier General, Day retired. But years later, with his children grown and a lifetime of service to his country behind him, he would engage in another battle, this one against an opponent he never had expected: his own country. On his side would be the hundreds of thousands of veterans who had fought for America only to be betrayed. And what would happen next would make Bud Day an even greater legend.</p><p>Robert Coram is the author of four nonfiction books and seven novels. His articles have appeared in the New Yorker and other national magazines, and he was twice nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for his work as a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Coram's superb biography of the most decorated living American veteran begins with Bud Day's Great Plains childhood and takes him through joining the air force, marrying his high-school sweetheart, and flying ever-more-demanding missions in Vietnam. After his luck ran out, he escaped from the first POW camp in which he was interned but was recaptured and endured five years of torture in a second. Retiring with the Medal of Honor, he returned to public life a generation later, launching breach-of-contract suits against the Clinton administration for what he perceived as its bad faith in dealing with Vietnam veterans. Although partially disabled and an ongoing sufferer from PTSD, Day remains active in veterans' affairs and Republican politics. Coram's motives for writing the book--see the preface--may raise some eyebrows, but as he did for his previous fighter-pilot biography, <i>Boyd</i> (2002), he has researched thoroughly and written fluently and with sympathy for his subject, an authentic hero worthy of many books. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Mrs. Hodge wrote: ''All in all the Kachinas are lovable and kindly supernaturals who bring rain and other blessings to the people.'' The legends of the Kachinas are a unifying and cohesive force in the continuance of Native American social history. In these stories, you discover why Kachinas wear feathers, how Tihkuyi created the game animals, why the war chiefs abandoned latiku, how the rattlesnakes came to be what they are and other events from the past. This book makes an ideal companion to <i>Coyote Tales from the Indian Pueblos,</i> also published by Sunstone Press..</p><p>Kachinas are both the gods of the southwestern Pueblos and the physical embodiments of these gods in the form of ceremonial masks and statues. These stories, collected and originally published by Hodge ( The Kachinas Are Coming ) in the 1930s, testify to the importance of the kachinas, upon whom the survival and order of the physical world depend. In one tale, the kachinas take corn from the people who have forgotten its sacred nature and begun to treat it casually. Many stories anthropomorphically explain characteristics of animals. Ants, for instance, have tiny waists because they were scourged too hard around their middles at their kachina initiation. The relationship of these spirits and ritual objects to the popular dolls is discussed in a brief but interesting introduction. Although not designed for children, these stories will perhaps best be thought of as bedtime reading. This very brief anthology only scratches the surface of the rich body of legends surrounding kachinas. Most serious is the failure to indicate from which Pueblo tradition or tribe a given story springs. This would have given some indication of the variety of expression found among these diverse cultures. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.''Thoroughly sympathetic in her attitude toward the Southwest Indians and their legends, [Hodge] has retold these stories with simplicity and a grave dignity that is very pleasing.'' --<i>The New York Times</i><br><br>''These stories ... testify to the importance of the kachinas, upon whom the survival and order of the physical world depend.'' --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>''In societies that have no written language, the role of the storyteller is extremely important because he or she passes on to the next generation the traditions of the [Native American] tribe. A major factor in remembering the stories is that they must be interesting, as is evident in this collection of Pueblo Indian tales of how things came to be in the world.'' --<i>Denver Westerners Roundup</i></p><h2>Tibet Wild: A Naturalist&#39;s Journeys on the Roof of the World</h2><p>As one of the world&#x2019;s leading field biologists, George Schaller has spent much of his life traversing wild and isolated places in his quest to understand and conserve threatened species&#x2014;from mountain gorillas in the Virunga to pandas in the Wolong and snow leopards in the Himalaya. Throughout his celebrated career, Schaller has spent more time in Tibet than in any other part of the world, devoting more than thirty years to the wildlife, culture, and landscapes that captured his heart and continue to compel him to protect them.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>Tibet Wild</i> is Schaller&#x2019;s account of three decades of exploration in the most remote stretches of Tibet: the wide, sweeping rangelands of the Chang Tang and the hidden canyons and plunging ravines of the southeastern forests. As engaging as he is enlightening, Schaller illustrates the daily struggles of a field biologist trying to traverse the impenetrable Chang Tang, discover the calving grounds of the chiru or Tibetan antelope, and understand the movements of the enigmatic snow leopard.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> As changes in the region accelerated over the years, with more roads, homes, and grazing livestock, Schaller watched the clash between wildlife and people become more common&#x2014;and more destructive. Thus what began as a purely scientific endeavor became a mission: to work with local communities, regional leaders, and national governments to protect the unique ecological richness and culture of the Tibetan Plateau.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Whether tracking brown bears, penning fables about the tiny pika, or promoting a conservation preserve that spans the borders of four nations, Schaller has pursued his goal with a persistence and good humor that will inform and charm readers.&nbsp; <i>Tibet Wild</i> is an intimate journey through the changing wilderness of Tibet, guided by the careful gaze and unwavering passion of a life-long naturalist.</p><p>George Schaller is vice president of Panthera and a senior conservationist at the Wildlife Conservation Society, both organizations based in New York, as well as adjunct professor with the Center of Nature and Society at Peking University in China.&nbsp;He has explored&nbsp; many remote corners of the planet, conducted wildlife research and conservation work in over twenty countries, and is a prolific author.&nbsp;His field work began in 1952 in Alaska and he was part of a 1956 expedition to northeastern Alaska which led to the establishment of America's largest protected area, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.<br>&nbsp;Spending most of his time in the field in Asia, Africa, and South America, Schaller has done seminal studies and helped protect some of the planet's most iconic animals.&nbsp;These range from mountain gorillas in the present Democratic Republic of the Congo, tigers in India, lions in Tanzania, and jaguars in Brazil, to giant pandas and wildlife on the Tibetan Plateau in China, and snow leopards and various wild sheep and goats in the Himalaya of Nepal and Pakistan.&nbsp;This work has been the basis for his scientific and popular writings, including 16 books, among them <i>The Year of the Gorilla</i>, <i>The Deer and the Tiger</i>, <i>The Serengeti Lion</i> (a National Book Award winner), <i>The Last Panda</i>, <i>A Naturalist and other Beasts</i>, and <i>Tibet Wild</i>.&nbsp;He has also helped to establish about a dozen protected areas in various countries.<br>&nbsp;Over the years, he has received a number of international conservation awards, including the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement and the Indianapolis Prize in the USA, China's Baogang Environmental Prize, Japan's Cosmos Prize, India's Salim Ali Conservation Award, and the gold medal of the World Wildlife Fund.<br>&nbsp;With his wife, Kay, a close colleague in the field, they raised their two sons while on projects in various countries."In <i>Tibet Wild</i>, he not only offers a case study in protecting an obscure mammal on tricky political turf but also reflects on his previous projects, many of which resulted in protected, self-sustaining populations of once-imperiled species...[It] has a valedictory quality. Mr. Schaller revisits old journals and quotes from earlier works such as <i>The Last Panda</i>. During freezing cold nights in his field tent, he tries to puzzle out whether his youthful experience of war and subsequent immigration to the United States as an enemy alien helped to form his reticent character, his distaste for crowds, technology and weapons, his wanderlust, and his attraction to stark places like the Chang Tang. Distinguished by these reflections, <i>Tibet Wild</i> would be a fine introduction to Mr. Schaller's writing and remarkably accomplished life for new readers." <br> (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>"To protect unspoiled places, Schaller must shed his natural reticence to negotiate with his fellow human beings. In the case of the high steppes, these include families putting out poison for animals wrongly perceived as pests, herders trading horses for motorcycles and, more threatening, gold miners. He's willing to sit down and educate people, sometimes even to compromise, but he has no sympathy for those who get a charge out of reducing the number of his beloved animals one at a time. Late in <i>Tibet Wild</i>, Schaller briefly shares a camp with a foreign hunter who's grousing that he had to wait three whole days to get his final shot at a Marco Polo ram, whose massive curved horns are a coveted trophy. Schaller, the man who spent 17 years trying to find the chiru's calving ground, has little patience for such behavior. 'Hunting is not a sport,' he notes. 'Animals don't just lose, they die.'" <br> (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>"Poignant ...<i>Tibet Wild</i>...lays out an open-ended account of the struggle to save wild places and their inhabitants. I can't recall any book that has made me care as much or think harder about how we might do that."

In this richly textured chronicle of five decades of world travels, he combines a provocative apologia with unforgettable tales of his encounters with gorillas, tigers, pandas, snow leopards, and jaguars. ... Schaller's forthright, enlightening book of discovery reseeds our appreciation for the wonders of the planet, perception of the 'heavy human hand on the landscape,' and recognition of the need for a global 'conservation ethic.'" <br> (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"His descriptions...are particularly evocative, and give the lie to notions of glamour in field biology....fascinating" <br> (<i>BBC Wildlife Magazine</i>)<br><br>"<i>Tibet Wild</i> is one of Schaller's best works, combining wild adventure with insightful recommendations for people and nature.

By the author of The Tomb and Legacies. 40,000 first printing.</p><p>Reading a Repairman Jack novel seems, at times, a guilty pleasure; it's astonishingly easy to inhale the pages, like eating potato chips. A firm-jawed Mr. Fixit hero with a cryptic past--<i>crunch</i>! Crimes that go beyond (way, waaay beyond) the norms of traditional law--<i>smack</i>! A liberal sprinkling of screwball comedy <i>and</i> nasty supernatural beings--now <i>that's</i> tasty! Good, crispy fun, indeed. But F. Paul Wilson's tight plotting and appealing characters manage to elevate potato chips to the realm of haute cuisine (or at least a satisfyingly solid meal), and his latest, <i>All the Rage</i>, is no exception. <p> Everything's rosy when Nadia Radzminsky takes a dream research job at GEM Pharmaceuticals: she'll be working for her professional idol, Dr. Luc Monnet; her fianc� is one of GEM's top salespeople; she's got all sorts of high tech toys to play with; and she'll get a million-dollar bonus if she can just figure out how to stabilize GEM's most promising molecule (dubbed, ominously enough for students of Norse mythology, Loki). But clouds quickly appear on the horizon in the form of Milos Dragovic, a Serbian mobster with a short fuse, a big wallet, and a profound interest in Loki's future. Nadia suspects Milos is blackmailing her boss, and she hires Jack to find out what's going on.</p><p> What Jack finds out isn't pretty: Loki is leading an underground life as Berzerk, a hot, new street drug that brings out the user's most aggressive behavior, frequently with deadly consequences. And Milos may be pushing Monnet around, but the good doctor isn't objecting too strongly to the payoff. But when Jack gets closer to the source of the mystery molecule, events take a very personal turn: Loki is derived from the blood of rakoshi, those otherworldly and decidedly vicious demons Jack had sworn to exterminate in <i>Conspiracies</i>. With his family threatened by both the rakoshi and the vengeful Serb, Jack must take on both the monster and the mob. </p><p> <i>All the Rage</i> has the necessary ingredients for success, including a snarkily amusing subplot involving a Brooklyn junkyard owner who's also out for Milos's blood (Jack has to keep toning down his client's eager revenge plots, and his substitution of industrial sludge for knives in one such plan is particularly amusing). Dedicated Wilson fans will rejoice in the new addition to the series, and neophytes will scramble to unearth the earlier installments. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>This is the signed limited edition of ALL THE RAGE, signed by Harry O.

Tour.</p><p>Brodeur continues to sound the urgent alarm he's rung in Currents of Death (1989) and elsewhere about the dangers of electromagnetic fields (EMF) produced by power lines. Here, the author amasses compelling evidence that exposure to EMF causes or promotes cancer; that utility companies continue to deny the existence of any health hazard; and that state and federal health agencies have been reluctant to acknowledge the problem, let alone deal with it. Two major portions of the text- -material on cancer clusters in Guilford, Connecticut, and at the Slater School in Fresno, California--appeared originally in The New Yorker. Besides recounting in meticulous detail the actions and frustrations of concerned citizens in these two situations, Brodeur has researched numerous other instances in which citizens and power companies have clashed over the EMF issue. His account of EPA's shifting position provides an unflattering view of a federal agency succumbing to political pressure. Drawing parallels with the tobacco and asbestos industries' resistance to epidemiological evidence that their products are carcinogenic, Brodeur foresees that power companies will continue to claim that the scientific evidence against EMF is inconclusive. The legal battle is still in its early stages, and, according to the author, the ultimate outcome may well depend on how much public pressure is brought to bear on government health officials to view the power-line hazard as a medical problem rather than as a political and economic one. Brodeur must be credited with helping to keep this issue in the public eye. Vigorous and persuasive reporting, backed by impressive research. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This eye-opening book attempts to blow the lid off a volatile situation, much as Brodeur did several years ago when he tackled the dangers of asbestos in buildings. Now, he writes of something many people have suspected for years: living near electric substations or high-tension power lines is not good for you. Brodeur introduces a sleepy little street in Connecticut where the incidence of cancer is high--too high. He then hopscotches across the country to Southern California, Florida, Illinois, and New Jersey, each time introducing people who either live on a street near a substation or teach in an elementary school near high-tension power lines. Invariably, when concerns are raised about the health issues involved, utility company officials respond by stating that evidence that links power lines to illness is inconclusive. More shockingly, all levels of government seem to be holding hands with said electric companies. Brodeur's exhaustive research helps make the book the definitive account of the problem so far, but be prepared to wade through a ton of statistics and facts only occasionally interrupted by interviews with the people involved, including victims, utility company and government officials, and researchers. <i>Joe Collins</i></p><h2>King Suckerman</h2><p>In the summer of 1976, the nation&#39;s capital is gearing up for the Bicentennial.

The Society is entirely free from educational, political, or ecclesiastical control. Dedicated to an idealistic approach to the solution of human problems, the Society&#39;s program stresses the need for the integration of religion, philosophy, and the science of psychology into one system of instruction. The goal of this instruction is to enable the individual to develop a mature philosophy of life, to recognize his proper responsibilities and opportunities, and to understand and appreciate his place in the unfolding universal pattern.Manly P. Hall was the founder of the Philosophical Research Society. In over seventy-five years of dynamic public activity, he delivered more than 8,000 lectures in the United States and abroad, and authored countless books, essays, and articles. In his lectures and writings, Manly Hall always emphasized the practical aspects of philosophy and religion as they applied to daily living. He restated for modern man those spiritual and ethical doctrines which have given humanity its noblest ideals and most adequate codes of conduct. Believing that philosophy is a working tool to help the individual in building a solid foundation for his dreams and purposes, Manly Hall steadfastly sought recognition of the belief that world civilization can be perfected only when human beings meet on a common ground of intelligence, cooperation, and worthy purpose.</p><h2>A Whistling Woman</h2><p><b>A Whistling Woman</b><i> </i>portrays the antic, thrilling, and dangerous period of the late &#x2018;60s as seen through the eyes of a woman whose life is forever changed by her times.<br><br>Frederica Potter, a smart, spirited 33-year-old single mother, lucks into a job hosting a groundbreaking television talk show based in London. Meanwhile, in her native Yorkshire where her lover is involved in academic research, the university is planning a prestigious conference on body and mind, and a group of students and agitators is establishing an &#x201c;anti-university.&#x201d; And nearby a therapeutic community is beginning to take the shape of a religious cult under the influence of its charismatic religious leader.<br><br><b>A Whistling Woman </b>is a brilliant and thought-provoking meditation on psychology, science, religion, ethics, and radicalism, and their effects on ordinary lives.</p><p>Anyone who has followed the adventures of Frederica and her friends from <i>The Virgin in the Garden</i> through <i>Still Life</i> and <i>Babel Tower</i> will find it impossible to resist <i>A Whistling Woman</i>, the conclusion of A.S. Byatt's masterful quartet on postwar English life and manners. The first book in the series was set in the early 1950s, and <i>A Whistling Woman</i> carries the story through the end of the 1960s. While it lives up to the sweep and gravitas of the earlier volumes, it is slow going at the start, crowded with characters and ideas, not all of which are equally compelling. University politics, feminism, television, psychology, the advent of mass culture, and the emerging science of neurobiology each figure large, although Byatt's emphasis is on the old trio of love, madness, and religion. These novels cover much of the same ground as her sister Margaret Drabble did in <i>The Radiant Way</i> and elsewhere, but have more in common with the work of Iris Murdoch, whose novels showed a similar sympathy for--and fascination with--unreasoned acts of passion. <i>A Whistling Woman</i> is a brilliant evocation of the intellectual and social life of 1960s Britain, with allowance for the occasional grisly murder. <i>--Regina Marler</i>&#x201c;A. S. Byatt is one of the few contemporary fiction writers&#x2013;Don DeLillo is another&#x2013;for whom the conceptual world is almost as important as the characters they invent and the passions they explore...There is no other writer alive who is as interested as Byatt in creating characters who are thinking women and men while at the same time recognizing the limits of cognition in the face of unreason, or love...Her canvas is stretched to bursting, as though she wanted to get in everything she had ever been curious about and hadn&#x2019;t apprised us of...whether it&#x2019;s Wittgenstein&#x2019;s taste in interior d�cor or the physiology of memory....Mesmerizing.&#x201d; &#x2013;Daphne Merkin, <i>New York Time Book Review<br></i><br>&#x201c;<i>A Whistling Woman</i> is the fourth in a quartet of novels...Each volume can be read independently, but they are addictive...Byatt illuminates and challenges many of our prejudices and assumptions...brought to life by a vivid panoply of characters...As in all of her best books, Byatt&#x2019;s spine-chilling narrative and complex characters render its daunting intellectual heft almost weightless.&#x201d; &#x2013;Tess Lewis, <i>The Sun</i><br><br>&#x201c;Full of new energy and a sense of new directions...It is always tempting, with this novelist, to talk about the ideas or the observations, unfailingly rich and tantalizing. The superb mastery of it, however, is in what Arnold Bennett would have admired: the skill of the novelist with character, story, world. The plot has a driving ferocity, the huge and extraordinary cast marshaled with exceptional dexterity. The physical details are effortlessly redolent of the period, and exactly evocative of the individual psychology...This is a novel with grand, general interests, but the mastery over the particular never flags...This is a novel, a cycle of novels, a body of work for the rest of your life.&#x201d; &#x2013;Philip Hensher, <i>The Spectator<b><br></b></i><br>&#x201c;A. S. Byatt has often been accused of intellectual over-egging, of a clever cleverness that overshadows plot and character. It&#x2019;s a question of balance which every serious novelist attempting to write, in Byatt&#x2019;s words, &#x2018;about the life of the mind as well as of society and the relations between people&#x2019; must resolve. <i>Possession</i> achieved this brilliantly. Her new novel, <i>A Whistling Woman,</i> comes close too. In this concluding installment [of her quartet of novels], Byatt blends her own excitement at &#x2018;intellectual curiosity of any kind&#x2019; with a lucid narrative and gripping plot...I suspect her fans will be hoping for a fifth.&#x201d; &#x2013;Kate Bingham, <i>Independent<br></i><br>&#x201c;Byatt&#x2019;s intellectual adventure is full of energy and vitality...[with] solid delights, keen and demanding pleasure.&#x201d; &#x2013;Allan Massie, <i>The Scotsman<br></i><br>&#x201c;The comparison between George Eliot&#x2019;s writing and that of Byatt has been frequently and justly made. Byatt&#x2019;s four novels are complex, lively, muscular, moral and rather masculine books whose celebration of cleverness and strong feeling is intensely invigorating. I hope this isn&#x2019;t really the last of them.&#x201d; &#x2013;Jane Shilling, <i>Evening Standard<br></i><br>&#x201c;Byatt is unusual not in combining the roles of scholar and writer, but in insisting on their duality loudly, publicly and in the fabric of her fiction...At her best&#x2013;and this latest is among her best&#x2013;she is someone intimately acquainted with grief. She knows its violence and its faltering retreat. This, ultimately, is the grandeur of her novels.&#x201d; &#x2013;Ruth Scurr, <i>Times Literary Supplement<br></i><br>&#x201c;The life of the mind and the confusions of the spirit confront one another to often telling effect in Byatt&#x2019;s lavishly orchestrated eighth novel...<i>A Whistling Woman</i> excites and satisfies, because Byatt has learned from her idol Iris Murdoch the technique of creating characters whose obsessions appear to rise from deep within, and appropriate their rich, mysterious personalities...Byatt&#x2019;s quartet is well worth the time and attention it demands.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Kirkus</i> (starred review)<br><br>&#x201c;The last in Byatt&#x2019;s magnificent quartet of novels on intellectual life and thought in the 1950s and 1960s, <i>A Whistling Woman</i> can be read on its own. Rich in metaphor and glancing allusion, it is a tale of learning and anti-learning, sects and cults, the complex sexual relationships of humans and snails. [It is] predominantly a novel of ideas. Not about politics, foreign or domestic, but about philosophy, psychology and literature; the excitement of genetics and computer science edging towards their breakthroughs...pulling you along. It makes a fine conclusion to the quartet.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The Economist<br></i></p><h2>Blood Rubies: A Josie Prescott Antiques Mystery (Josie Prescott Antiques Mysteries)</h2><p><p>Ana Yartsin is on the verge of becoming a celebrity chef.

Her first novel, <i>Consigned to Death</i>, was an Independent Mystery Booksellers Association bestseller and was nominated for the Macavity, Agatha, and David book awards. The second in the series, <i>Deadly Appraisal</i>, won the David Award for Best Novel, as did the seventh, <i>Dolled Up for Murder.</i><p>CHAPTER ONE</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Ana Yartsin stood beside one of her custom Faberg�-egg-shaped wedding cakes, unfazed by the frenetic activity swirling around her. The film crew was larger than I&#x2019;d anticipated&#x2014;I counted twenty-two people, including a uniformed security guard&#x2014;and they all seemed to be doing things with frantic urgency. A young woman with pink hair and a star tattoo on her neck dabbed at Ana&#x2019;s cheek with a fluffy powder puff. Someone named Mack called to someone named Vinnie to check the light meter. The security guard, a big guy with a crew cut and a gun on his hip, stood near Ana, his eyes on the move. Timothy Brenin, the producer/director, dashed up to talk to a short man with spiky yellow hair carrying a clipboard, then called to Mack that we had another hour of good sun.</p> <p>Timothy, tall and lean like a greyhound, dressed all in black like the New Yorker he was, approached Ana with a huge smile. I&#x2019;d met Timothy briefly last week when I&#x2019;d stopped by to order a cake for my office manager Gretchen&#x2019;s baby shower. He and Ana had asked me to come back and place the order again, this time on camera. They were in the early stages of filming a TV pilot for a reality show based on Ana&#x2019;s life, capitalizing on her dual role as a newly minted celebrity pastry chef with an ability to communicate Martha Stewartesque tips for gracious living and a recently divorced young woman ready for a fresh start.</p> <p>Timothy spotted me, and his smile grew even broader. &#x201c;Good to see you again, Josie!&#x201d; He turned to Ana. &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t everyone be like her&#x2014;on time and smiling?&#x201d;</p> <p>Ana laughed. &#x201c;Because she&#x2019;s one of a kind. Lucky us!&#x201d;</p> <p>Timothy squeezed my arm affectionately, then turned toward Ana. &#x201c;I just took a call from <i>People</i> wanting to know the skinny on the show.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, Timothy!&#x201d; Ana exclaimed. &#x201c;What a coup!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I knew your life would be perfect for a reality show!&#x201d;</p> <p>Ana laughed. &#x201c;Talk about an upside-down compliment. My life is so chaotic, it&#x2019;s ideal for a prime-time expos�.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;True, true.&#x201d; Timothy flashed another grin, then flitted away calling something to Mack about moving cameras to catch the sun. Vinnie wheeled a camera to the left. &#x201c;No, no! To the right. The <i>right</i>!&#x201d;</p> <p>Ana&#x2019;s eyes twinkled. &#x201c;Survive a nasty divorce and a breach with your father, start to bake wedding and special occasion cakes based on Faberg� eggs, move to a small town on the rugged coast of New Hampshire where you don&#x2019;t know a soul, start a business on a wing and a prayer, and you, too, can have a reality TV show.&#x201d;</p> <p>I chuckled. &#x201c;I think the fact that you&#x2019;ve won a gazillion awards for your pastries might have a little something to do with it, to say nothing of your charisma. Oh, let&#x2019;s not forget that your Faberg� egg cakes aren&#x2019;t just gorgeous, they&#x2019;re unbelievably delicious, too.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re very sweet, Josie, but I cannot tell a lie&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve only won a couple of awards.&#x201d;</p> <p>I waved her correction away. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re destined for great success.&#x201d; I raised my chin and spoke in a tone of mock superiority. &#x201c;Do not argue with me. I know these things.&#x201d;</p> <p>She laughed, a pretty tinkling sound. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; She squeezed my hand. &#x201c;You sure know how to puff a girl up.&#x201d;</p> <p>Timothy stood in the center of the driveway and did a 180-degree survey, taking in the position of the ribbons of thick black cables and the pole-mounted overhead lights and reflective panels. He nodded and turned toward Ana. &#x201c;All right, darling, get ready for your closing monologue.&#x201d;</p> <p>The yellow-haired man hurried over to help Ana down from her canvas-backed director&#x2019;s chair and led her to a spot near the edge of her undulating lawn overlooking the serene sun-flecked ocean. She wore a lightweight baby blue buttoned-to-the-neck cashmere cardigan with a blue and tan floral-patterned swirly skirt and tan pumps. Her shoulder-length honey gold hair shone in the midday sun. She was my age, midthirties, but she looked younger. I moved off to the side, out of the way.</p> <p>Timothy shouted, &#x201c;Rolling!&#x201d; A moment later he called, &#x201c;Action!&#x201d;</p> <p>Ana smiled at the camera as if it were a friend. &#x201c;Heather and Jason did exactly the right thing in talking to me at length about their dream wedding cake. They didn&#x2019;t use vague words like &#x2018;beautiful.&#x2019; They were specific. They wanted a milk chocolate cake with gold-colored creamy frosting. They wanted the swan boats from Boston Public Garden, where Jason proposed, represented in the decorations.&#x201d; Ana paused for a second, letting her words sink in. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the lesson: Everyone involved in helping you plan your wedding or special event wants nothing more than for you to be thrilled with the result&#x2014;but they can&#x2019;t read your mind. You need to know what you want, and you need to communicate it clearly. Do that&#x201d;&#x2014;she paused again and smiled, a dazzler&#x2014;&#x201c;and your dreams will come true.&#x201d;</p> <p>Three seconds later, Timothy yelled, &#x201c;Cut! Fabulous, Ana, just perfect!&#x201d;</p> <p>My scene was scheduled next.</p> <p>&#x201c;Let me give you a quick once-over, Josie.&#x201d; The pink-haired woman appeared from the left and stared at my face.</p> <p>&#x201c;I just came from the makeup tent,&#x201d; I told her.</p> <p>&#x201c;And it shows. You look awesome! You just need a tiny de-shining.&#x201d;</p> <p>Her feathery puff tickled, and I giggled.</p> <p>Once I was sufficiently de-shined, I joined Ana, waiting for me by the lawn. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a hard act to follow, Ana. I hope I don&#x2019;t mess up.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do great.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Just act naturally,&#x201d; Timothy instructed.</p> <p>I laughed. &#x201c;Right. Like it&#x2019;s an everyday occurrence that I&#x2019;m filmed ordering a cake.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Once you&#x2019;ve completed your appraisal of the Faberg� Spring Egg snow globe, Timothy wants to record us discussing it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;At least I&#x2019;ll be on comfortable ground. Compared to this, talking about antiques is easy. Speaking of which, are we still on schedule?&#x201d;</p> <p>Ana held up crossed fingers. &#x201c;Dad checked in for his flight. He&#x2019;ll be here tomorrow, snow globe in hand.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Is the egg as beautiful as Ana says?&#x201d; Timothy asked, an anticipatory gleam in his eye.</p> <p>&#x201c;From the photos, oh my. Picture this: a huge, perfectly round snow globe. Visible through the glass is a baby pink enamel egg. On the egg is an enamel and emerald tree, dripping with diamond and rose quartz cherry blossoms. When the globe is gently shaken, silvery slivers create an illusion of rain. You push a spring-loaded latch and boom! The egg pops open. Inside is a gold-and silver-colored basket filled with five ruby red tulips.&#x201d;</p> <p>Timothy rubbed his hands together and made a lip-smacking noise. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to see it.&#x201d; Something in the background caught his eye, and he shouted to Mack. &#x201c;Back up camera three for a long shot. I want to get Josie walking <i>up</i> the driveway toward the garage. <i>Up,</i> not down.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a kitchen, not a garage!&#x201d; Ana protested, laughing.</p> <p>&#x201c;Absolutely, darlin&#x2019;! Josie, you start walking toward the structure that looks like a garage from the end of the driveway. You&#x2019;re excited. You&#x2019;re hopeful that Ana&#x2019;s cake will make Gretchen happy. Got it?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Got it,&#x201d; I said, feeling awkward, hoping I wouldn&#x2019;t get tongue-tied or stupidly giggly, wanting to do well for Ana. My mouth went dry. I hate being in the limelight.</p> <p>&#x201c;See ya in a sec,&#x201d; Ana said merrily. She walked to the office-cum-studio-cum-commercial-kitchen she&#x2019;d built in her detached garage, a stopgap until her bakery business was large enough to justify a full-blown production facility, and disappeared inside.</p> <p>Everyone was looking at me. My heart pounded against my ribs and my throat closed and my cheeks burned.</p> <p>Timothy stood off to the side, near the pathway that led to the house. &#x201c;Pretend we aren&#x2019;t here, Josie.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, then started coughing. &#x201c;Sorry about that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No prob!&#x201d; Timothy said. &#x201c;Take your time.&#x201d;</p> <p>The yellow-haired man appeared with a glass of water, and after I&#x2019;d sipped some, the pink-haired woman studied my lips, then nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;Start again,&#x201d; Timothy said.</p> <p><i>Fake it till you make it,</i> my dad used to say. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; I said, and this time my voice sounded like me, like a calm and controlled me. I started up the driveway toward the renovated garage.</p> <p>&#x201c;Rolling!&#x201d; Timothy yelled. &#x201c;Action!&#x201d;</p> <p>The sun was bright for March. A soft breeze rustled the tall grasses that grew along the property edge. I reminded myself to smile. I felt silly smiling at nothing, but I did it anyway.</p> <p>Ana stepped out as if I&#x2019;d called her. Her warm and welcoming smile reached her eyes and drew a more genuine smile in response from me.</p> <p>&#x201c;Josie! I&#x2019;m so glad you&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thanks, Ana. What a beautiful location.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; She gazed out over the ocean. &#x201c;When I was a kid, this was where we spent summers. I&#x2019;m delighted to be back in Rocky Point, to be a permanent resident.&#x201d; She turned to face me. &#x201c;Come on in and tell me how I can help.&#x201d;</p> <p>We stepped inside together. The walls and ceiling were painted snow white; the chairs were persimmon and cobalt. I could hear faint clinking and whirrs from the bakers at work in the rear.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, wow,&#x201d; I said, looking around. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so elegant.&#x201d;</p> <p>A score of mahogany easels positioned in four diagonal rows showed two-part photos, fronts and backs, of various Faberg�-egg-shaped cakes, some large enough to serve a hundred people, most sized as individual portions. Just as each of the eggs Peter Carl Faberg� made for the Russian imperial family from 1885 to 1917 held at least one surprise, so too did Ana&#x2019;s cakes. From one side, the cakes appeared to be ornately decorated ovals. From the other side, the &#x201c;surprise&#x201d; was visible, positioned in a hollowed-out area reminiscent of an open-air theater. The surprises varied according to the occasion, the season, and Ana&#x2019;s whimsy; they included bouquets of flowers, a throne, a woodland scene, and a traditional bride and groom exchanging vows. All decorative elements were crafted out of frosting.</p> <p>After I&#x2019;d walked the aisles taking in all the options, Ana asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the occasion?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;My office manager, Gretchen, is having a baby. I&#x2019;m throwing a surprise Jack and Jill baby shower for her and her husband.&#x201d; I told her the date and grinned. &#x201c;I expect about thirty people. I think Gretchen and Jack would love one of your Faberg� egg cakes.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Wonderful! Do you have a theme in mind?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hawaii. That&#x2019;s where Gretchen and her husband met and fell in love.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How lovely. We could do a couple gazing at a baby in a lei-draped cradle with some palm trees and turquoise water in the background.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That sounds perfect. Maybe with a rising moon.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I love that idea!&#x201d;</p> <p>Ten minutes later, after I selected pineapple cake with orange-mango frosting, signed the order form, and left a deposit, Ana walked me out.</p> <p>&#x201c;Cut!&#x201d; Timothy called. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got it. That&#x2019;s a wrap. Take fifteen and we&#x2019;ll pick up with Ana&#x2019;s Tips for Gracious Living.&#x201d; He squeezed Ana&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;Ana, you just keep getting better!&#x201d; To me, he added, &#x201c;Well done, Josie! Thanks.&#x201d;</p> <p>I felt light-headed with relief that it was over. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you have a minute?&#x201d; Ana asked me as I turned to leave. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to introduce you to my friend, Heather, and her fianc�, Jason. I&#x2019;ve known Heather for years. Jason is an investment guy&#x2014;Jason Ferris&#x2014;do you know him? You might have seen him on TV.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a pretty big deal in some circles.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You sound skeptical.&#x201d;</p> <p>Ana laughed. &#x201c;Not so much skeptical as jealous. All the time they&#x2019;ve been dating, a couple of years now, I&#x2019;ve just been trying to cover the rent. Here he is, the building-personal-wealth guru. Having &#x2018;wealth&#x2019; is a foreign concept.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;My gut tells me that&#x2019;s about to change for you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;From your mouth to God&#x2019;s ears.&#x201d; I followed her across the driveway to the fieldstone path that led to the porch. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mean to sound disingenuous.&#x201d; She laughed, half self-deprecating and half thrilled. &#x201c;The last six months have been incredible. I have to remind myself that it&#x2019;s okay to celebrate a little.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Is that why you started your snow globe collection?&#x201d; I asked, thinking of the two snow globes she&#x2019;d already delivered to us for appraisal, one a Victorian Christmas scene, the other featuring a winsome black-haired beauty ice-skating with a handsome cavalier on a glistening frozen pond.</p> <p>She&#x2019;d purchased both at a Midwest antiques store because she&#x2019;d fallen in love with them, one of the joys of collecting. They were sold &#x201c;as is,&#x201d; with no information provided or available about the objects&#x2019; history or authenticity. From the lightbulb logo on the base, we were hopeful that the Christmas scene was an original Vienna Snow Globes creation. The other one remained a mystery.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes, actually,&#x201d; Ana said. &#x201c;A thousand dollars may not sound like much to some people, but to me, that I had an extra thousand dollars in the budget&nbsp;&#x2026; well, it&#x2019;s huge. If you tell me they&#x2019;re only worth two dollars each&#x2026;&#x201d; She laughed. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not go there.&#x201d;</p> <p>I wished I could reassure her, but we never revealed partial information. It wasn&#x2019;t unusual for an antique that seemed promising at the start of the appraisal to turn out to be phony, and vice versa.</p> <p>After a few seconds, I asked, &#x201c;How do you know Heather?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been friends since we were kids&#x2014;our families spent summers up here. She and I lived together in Boston for a couple of years after college, until she got serious with a guy and moved in with him&#x2014;my brother, actually.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That sounds as if it might be awkward.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not until Peter caught her in bed with Jason.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Ouch.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Luckily, civility and maturity prevailed.&#x201d;</p> <p>We climbed onto the covered porch. Ana reached for the doorknob, then paused. She stood quietly for several seconds, looking down as if she were trying to figure out whether her shoes were too pointy. When she raised her eyes, I saw a complicated mix of emotions. Concern and apprehension, certainly, but there was more&#x2014;in addition to worry, I saw anger.</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; I asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;I just fibbed. Civility and maturity didn&#x2019;t rule, at least not at first. Peter punched Jason so hard he broke his nose.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yikes.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know. Fortunately, Jason decided not to press charges.&#x201d; She shrugged. &#x201c;To tell you the truth, I don&#x2019;t blame Jason. The media would have had a field day. A straight-arrow TV personality ends up on the losing end of a brawl over another man&#x2019;s live-in girlfriend. He&#x2019;d be a laughingstock, which wouldn&#x2019;t suit Jason&#x2019;s view of himself at all.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Definitely not good for business. How&#x2019;s Peter doing?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Fine, I guess. He sure dates a lot.&#x201d; Ana grinned. &#x201c;They tend to have curvy figures and names like Trixie and Bambi, if you catch my drift.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not necessarily wife material, but an effective antidote to heartbreak?&#x201d;</p> <p>She chuckled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s one way to put it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What about you and Heather? Did it affect your relationship?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Totally. I didn&#x2019;t speak to her for a year. I&#x2019;d trusted her completely. That she could do something like that shook me to my booties.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Like an earthquake.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Exactly. Ground I thought was stable wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yet here she is, helping you with your show.&#x201d;</p> <p>Ana turned and stared out over the ocean. &#x201c;She called me out of the blue last summer. I&#x2019;d just split with my husband.&#x201d; She shrugged and turned back to face me. &#x201c;Since Peter&#x2019;s doing all right, it&#x2019;s stupid for me to hold a grudge.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Good for you. Not holding grudges is a sign of real maturity.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you think so?&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go in so you can meet the guilty parties.&#x201d;</p> <p><i>All change is hard,</i> I thought. <i>Even when the change takes you back to familiar ground.</i></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copy...</p></p><h2>Frame-Up!: The Untold Story of Roscoe &#34;Fatty&#34; Arbuckle</h2><p>An investigative reporter reopens the case of Fatty Arbuckle, arguing that Virginia Rappe&#39;s murder, of which Arbuckle was accused, was the tragic result of a frame-up, and he points a finger at the movie moguls who resented Arbuckle&#39;s hefty salary</p><p>Edmonds's biography of the stage and screen star is as much an homage to Arbuckle (1887-1933) as it is an investigation into the sensational trial that virtually ruined the man and his career. Author of Hot Toddy ( LJ 4/15/89 ) and Let the Good Times Roll (Avon, 1984), Edmonds is a skilled writer who brings a wealth of information to the popular biography. She convincingly defends Arbuckle by presenting an in-depth psychological portrait while she exposes the underside of Hollywood power politics and its cost in human terms. The book is notable for its treatment of early Hollywood history, the relationships between stage and screen, producers and talent. Written for a general audience, this will do well with readers intrigued by celebrities, and those interested in screen and stage comics.<br><i>- Robert Rayher, Sch. of the Art Inst. of Chicago</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dragon of the Red Dawn (Magic Tree House # 37, A Merlin Mission)</h2><p>Merlin the Magician will not eat or sleep or speak to anyone in Camelot.

His program combines a modified diet (red meat is allowed in moderation), and daily doses of oat bran and the B-vitamin niacin. Kowalski elucidates the complex terminology of cholesterol and other bloodstream lipids, and aptly demonstrates how oat bran and niacin lower cholesterol and, in turn, that cholesterol lowering can be instrumental in reducing the incidence of heart disease. Roundups of foods least likely to bring about a cholesterol excess, as well as those with special properties that lower cholesterol, are particularly helpful, as are suggestions for substituting oat bran in traditional recipes. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Justice: A Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus Novel (Peter Decker &amp; Rina Lazarus Novels)</h2><p>Investigating the murder of a high-school prom queen, LAPD detective Sergeant Peter Decker emmerses himself in the world of teen sex and drugs but is unable to accept that the prime suspect is responsible. 75,000 first printing.

Lit Guild Main. Tour.</p><p>Lacey Farrell, the heroine of Mary Higgins Clark&#39;s 15th novel, is having a bit of an identity crisis. While working as a real estate agent in New York, Lacey witnessed a client&#39;s murder, and now she&#39;s in hiding with a new name and a new life. But changing her identity doesn&#39;t completely remove Lacey from the web of danger and deceit that surrounds the crime; new clues keep popping up that suggest some kind of link between Lacey&#39;s family and the murder. Meanwhile, a new man comes into the heroine&#39;s life, further complicating an already murky situation. As any fan will tell you, Mary Higgins Clark never fails to deliver plot twists and turns that are as unexpected as they are thrilling.What happens when a young woman, having merely been in the wrong place at the wrong time, is accidentally caught up in a dangerous murder investigation? <p>What happens when she is placed under police protection, forced to give up her identity and move to another part of the country, at least until the killer can be positively identified and apprehended? </p><p>What happens when in her new life she meets the perfect man, only she can't risk falling in love because she can't tell anyone -- even him, especially him -- who she really is? </p><p><i>Pretend You Don't See Her</i> is Mary Higgins Clark's brilliant and terrifying new novel, her fifteenth, and her most chilling and suspense-filled yet. Set in New York and in Minneapolis-St. Paul, it is the story of Lacey Farrell, a young rising star on Manhattan's high-powered and competitive real estate scene. </p><p>In the course of selling a luxurious skyline coop, Lacey becomes the witness to a murder and hears the dying words of the victim, a woman who is convinced that her attacker was after a journal kept by her daughter up until the day she died in what everyone but her grieving mother believes to have been a tragic accident. Lacey gives the journal to the police, but not before she makes a copy for herself -- an impetuous act that later proves to be almost fatal. </p><p>Obliged to give up her family, her job, her very identity, Lacey is placed in the witness protection program and sent to live in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where she must assume a new life, at least until the killer can be brought to trial. Once there, she meets and quickly finds herself attracted to Tom Lynch, a young radio talk-show host. He likewise is drawn to her -- but Lacey becomes so upset and confused by the life of lies she is forced to live that she tries to break off their burgeoning relationship. How can she commit to him when she can't even tell him her true name? </p><p>Then one day she discovers that the killer has traced her to Minneapolis and will soon place not only her but everyone around her in dire jeopardy. Realizing that she is no longer safe, she decides to go back to New York, determined to confront the threat to her life head on. </p><p>Armed with nothing more than her own courage and the ambiguous and mystifying clues found in the journal, Lacey is caught in a fast-paced race against time as she tries to uncover who was behind the deaths of the two women before she, too, is killed -- not realizing that the journal itself is the reason for the murders.... </p><p>Chilling, spine-tingling suspense is the hallmark of Mary Higgins Clark's novels.

But when school demands to allow her access to the Internet, she discovers Facebook and becomes friends with Fane, a local teenager who changes her whole world. This story will have you entangled from beginning to end.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;d always been told her life depended on staying in her rooms, and hadn&#x2019;t thought about what lay outside her door, knowing only it had the potential to be fatal to her.&#x201d; Not until her late teens does Rapunzel get a computer for her studies&#x2014;and then the real world emerges for the rather clueless young beauty. Kept prisoner in a tiny apartment within her mother&#x2019;s mansion, the girl believes she has an immunodeficiency disorder and would wither away in the outside world. Of course, the reader knows that Mother Gothel is up to something, what with the story&#x2019;s prologue and the diabolical hints. When Rapunzel reaches out on Facebook (where else?) to the local high school, she friends a handsome student intrigued by this sheltered mystery girl and determined to get to her. A suspenseful mix of romance, adventure, and dark arts, Bennett&#x2019;s fun take on the fairy tale might have been a bit more subtle with the bad guys&#x2019; missteps, but still compels readers to want to find out Rapunzel&#x2019;s backstory as much as she does.

Every Christian, no matter how rich or poor, how mature or young in the faith, faces difficulties that make him or her wonder where God is. Writer Dave Branon began to walk life&#x2019;s difficult valley in 2002 when his 17-year-old daughter Melissa died in a car accident. This book grows out of his own journey and his desire to provide hope to the hurting. Each devotional chapter is based on a scriptural truth, is realistic in its approach, and is supplemented with questions for personal reflection. In an easy-to-read fashion, Dave helps to answer the need of the struggling Christian for certainty and assurance of God&#x2019;s love.</p></p><p><p><i>Our Daily Bread</i> writer Dave Branon never expected to have valleys on the topographical map of his life. A trusting Christian, he was enjoying a life of blessing with his wife and four children. While life wasn&#x2019;t always perfect, Dave and his family were traveling on the road to peace and contentment, toward the mountain and far from the valley.</p><p>Until a beautiful spring evening in June 2002 when his daughter Melissa&#x2014;a vivacious, talented, happy seventeen-year-old&#x2014;was killed instantly when she was in a car accident on her way home from a day at the lake with her friends.</p><p>Dave describes the effect this had on him and his family: &#x201c;Our lives veered off the path we thought would be ours for the rest of our time on earth. We . . . went straight into the valley&#x2014;an unfamiliar, dark, and deep ravine of near hopelessness.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Beyond the Valley</i> has grown out of Dave&#x2019;s own journey and his desire to provide spiritual hope for the hurting. He writes honestly about the challenges he has faced, applying the light of Scripture to the darkest corners of life in the valley and providing questions for personal reflection that will encourage you on the path to hope.</p><p>&#x201c;Walk with me, won&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Dave asks. &#x201c;Together, we can find hope, solace, comfort, and sometimes even joy&#x2014;while seeking to go beyond the valley.&#x201d;</p><p>Dave Branon is a senior editor for Discovery House and has written articles for the&nbsp;<i>Our Daily Bread</i>&nbsp;devotional booklet since 1988.

Blanche is so timorous that she seems unsuited to the rigors of religious life even at the best of times - and horribly misplaced as the Reign of Terror begins to stain France with the blood of a new generation of Christian martyrs. <p>Sister Marie, one of the leading nuns in the convent, receives with joy the death threats of a ham-handed revolutionary: the sisters are going to be awarded the crown of Christian martyrdom! Sister Marie prepares the other nuns for this fearsome sacrifice, all the while harboring doubts about Blanche's ability and willingness to join them in giving up their lives for Christ. </p><p>Blanche's life thereafter and the story of the nuns take more than one unexpected twist, leaving you not only with the inspiring, true example of their martyrdom, but also with a penetrating insight into the nature of holiness. The spiritual acuity and deep compassion of author Gertrud von Le Fort make The Song at the Scaffold a unique meditation - as well as a powerfully moving novel, written with unusual dramatic force. It will make your soul surge with renewed and fervent love for God!</p></p><p>Gertrud von le Fort (1876-1971), who wrote so movingly in The Song at the Scaffold about Carmelite nuns who gave their lives for the Faith during the French Revolution was herself no stranger to religious persecution. Her ancestors, who were French Protestants, fled to Germany for religious freedom, and it was in the small town of Minden in Westphalia that she was born in 1876. <p>Von le Fort attended the Universities of Heidelberg and Berlin and was a student of the Protestant philosopher Ernst Troeltsch, whose works she edited. In 1925, she converted to the Catholic Faith. Key to her own conversion and in the characters and themes in her books is the importance of self-surrender. In Mary's humble fiat at the Annunciation ("Be it done unto me according to thy word"), in particular, von le Fort sees self-surrender not only as a symbol of the metaphysical aspect of woman, but as an example of the humility and reverence all creatures owe to God. Her philosophical treatise The Eternal Woman elaborates this theme. </p><p>In her novels, particularly in The Song at the Scaffold and The Veil of Veronica, her lowly, despised, inward-turning characters reveal the power of the inner life over the tumultuous, selfish ways of the world. "Through these quiet, unassuming women, through their weakness and cosmic fear, [von le Fort] indicates the spot at which grace may gain admittance to the soul of the modern man." </p><p>The call to self-surrender and humble reverence toward God, which shines forth in Gertrud von le Fort's writing, is as important for today's readers as it was two thousand years ago for the lowly maiden whose fiat raised her to be Queen of Heaven.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Usborne Illustrated Dictionary of Science (Usborne Illustrated Dictionaries)</h2><p>This is a new edition of this popular title, which provides a fantastic reference point for students studying for their SATs and GCSEs.

Drawing on his own experiences as a cowboy working in cattle and horse drives, Adams presents a vivid portrait of the challenges of trail life on a cattle drive from Texas to Montana�&#x20ac;&#x201d;the daily drudgery of cattle trailing, as well as the dramatic stampedes and other treacherous disruptions. Populated by a wide variety of well-drawn, lively characters, <b>The Log of a Cowboy</b> remains the landmark novel of the American West a century after its first appearance.</p> <ul> <li> First time in Penguin Classics </li> </ul></p><p>Andy Adams (1859&#x2013;1935) was an American writer of western fiction. Andy Adams was born in Indiana. His parents, Andrew and Elizabeth (Elliott) Adams, were pioneers. As a boy he helped with the cattle and horses on the family farm. In the early 1880s he went to Texas, where he stayed for 10 years, spending much of that time driving cattle on the western trail. In 1890 he left the trail to try his hand at business, but the venture failed, so he turned his hand to gold-mining in Colorado and Nevada. In 1894, he settled in Colorado Springs, where he lived until his death. He began writing at the age of 43, publishing his most successful book, The Log of a Cowboy, in 1903. His other works include A Texas Matchmaker (1904), The Outlet (1905), Cattle Brands (1906), Reed Anthony, Cowman: An Autobiography (1907), Wells Brothers (1911), and The Ranch on the Beaver (1927). The Log of a Cowboy is an account of a five-month drive of 3,000 cattle from Brownsville, Texas, to Montana in 1882 along the Great Western Cattle Trail. Although the book is fiction, it is firmly based on Adams's own experiences on the trail, and it is considered by many to be the best account of cowboy life in literature. Adams was disgusted by the unrealistic cowboy fiction being published in his day; The Log of a Cowboy was his response. It is still in print, and even modern reviewers consider it a compelling classic. The Chicago Herald said: "As a narrative of cowboy life, Andy Adams' book is clearly the real thing. It carries its own certificate of authentic first-hand experience on every page."This story of a real cowboy&#39;s life in the late nineteenth century includes long, dusty cattle drives, stampedes, river crossings and Indian attacks. The characters who people the &#34;Wild West&#34; are interesting and vividly described. However, Murphey is not an inspired reader. He has a pleasant voice but fails to add drama or intensity with pacing or even changing volume. This work is not very suitable for audio as it is not action packed nor is there much dialogue. The abridgment is also short and not engrossing. Though billed as a &#34;classic Western,&#34; this presentation will only appeal to real Western aficionados. S.C.A.

Yet many people do not know that his boyhood name was Curly, inspired by his curly hair. Curly was a leader even as a young boy, but his bravery could not prepare him for the trouble he and the other Lakota faced from the white settlers. After a fierce battle that mortally wounded Chief Conquering Bear, Curly felt called to help his people. So he defied traditional custom and ran away to seek a vision. Three days went by. Finally, as an exhausted Curly collapsed on the ground, the vision came&#x2014;a rider suspended above the ground and voices coming from nowhere. It took three years for Curly to understand his vision, and this long journey gave him the strength and leadership to guide his people. Because of this powerful vision, Curly&#x2019;s father renamed him Crazy Horse.Joseph Bruchac, of Abenaki Indian descent, is among the most respected and widely published Native American authors, with more than 150 books to his credit, including the popular Keepers of the Earth series.

Or so thinks Marcus Didius Falco, a private investigator first introduced in the award-winning SILVER PIGS, who's trying to prevent a murder before it happens. When every man a woman marries dies, Falco knows there's smoke and fire--and he'll stop at nothing to untangle the Gordion knot that proves it.</p><p>LINDSEY DAVIS has written nineteen novels, beginning with <i>The Course of Honour</i>, the love story of the Emperor Vespasian and Antonia Caenis.

Her books are translated into many languages and serialised on BBC Radio 4.

She was born in Birmingham but now lives in London.Ave Marcus Didius Falco! Once again Imperial Rome's wisecracking private investigator splendidly incarnates his time and placeas he uncovers a real estate development scam that proves the slum landlord is a long-established species. Fans of Silver Pigs and Shadows in Bronze will happily find Falco still sparring and making up with Helena Justina, the divorced daughter of a senator, carousing with his friend Petronius, captain of the Aventine Watch, obstructing his arch-enemy Anacrites, the Emperor Vespasian's chief spy, and trying to keep his mother and sisters at a comfortable distance. Here Falco is hired by two of the Hortensii, a group of freed slaves who have parlayed the legacy of their former owner into a fortune (which they display to vulgar excess), to investigate the thrice-widowed fiancee of one of their members. While Falco tries to prove that Severina Zotica has murdered her previous husbands, her betrothed is poisoned at a dinner with a notoriously unscrupulous developer and the detective must dig for other motives. Arson, evictions, skyrocketing rents, layered mortgage deals, another murder, near death for Helena and a brutal beating for himself spur Falco to ferret out the truth about the Hortensii and Severina. Period details, humor and Falco's modern sensibility add up to another sterling performance from Davis. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Leap over a Wall: Earthy Spirituality for Everday Christians</h2><p>Using the stories written in the Bible about the life of David, tales that explore such key themes as friendship, grief, love, sin, and suffering, the author of The Message sheds light on how every person can have a vital spirituality.</p><p>Of all the characters in the Bible, it is David who is most human.

Schindler</p><p>Chapter OnePesah<br>Feasting for Freedom<p>Passover (Pesah), which celebrates the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, begins on the fifteenth of the month of Nisan and continues for seven days, through Nisan 21, though many Diaspora communities celebrate it for eight days (see discussion of the second day of festivals in Appendixes 1. and 2). The name Passover is taken from the Exodus story: During the tenth and ultimate plague inflicted on Pharaoh to break his will, God passed over the Israelites and struck down only the Egyptian firstborn. That night Pharaoh finally agreed to let the Israelites go; and ever since then, we gather together on that night to commemorate that time, and to contemplate the meaning of being freed by the "mighty hand and outstretched arm" of the Holy One.</p><p>The central meaning of Passover is liberation, and hence it is also called <i>zeman heiruteinu</i> -- the season of our liberation. Another name for Passover is <i>hag ha-aviv</i> -- the holiday of spring. The Jewish calendar is set so that certain holidays always occur in a particular season of the year (unlike, for instance, the Moslem calendar). Thus, the holiday of liberation is also the holiday of spring, not simply by coincidence but by design. Following the bleakness of winter when everything is covered with the shrouds of snow, spring marks the rebirth of the earth with the bursting forth of green life. Similarly, a people enshackled in oppressive slavery, doomed to a slow process of degradation or even extinction, bursts forth out of Egypt into a new life's journey leading to a land flowing with milk and honey. The watchwords of both spring and Pesah are <i>rebirth</i> and <i>hope</i>. Thus, the spirit of renewed optimism aroused by the sights and smells of spring are reinforced in a Jewish context by Passover with its trumpeting of the possibilities of liberation. Passover reminds us annually that no matter how terrible our situation, we must not lose hope. Passover holds out the possibility of renewal, proclaiming that such change is as intrinsic to human nature as are blossoming trees to the natural world.</p><p>Another name for Pesah is <i>hag ha-matzot</i> -- the holiday of the unleavened bread. The matzah evokes images of that night when the Israelites ate the sacrificial lamb in fearful and eager anticipation of the future. Around them arose the wails of Egyptians mourning the deaths of their firstborn. Suddenly, the word came from Moses to hurry forth. The Israelites had no time to let the dough rise for bread, and so they carried with them this "matzah" as their only provisions.</p><p>Matzah as a symbol of liberation is meant to trigger in our minds the whole story, which began in slavery and ended in freedom. It also reminds us of God's role in the Exodus, for it recalls the simple faith of the Israelites, who were willing to leave the home they knew and go off into the desert. Having seen God's redemptive power, they trusted in His promise. As His people, they were willing to follow after Him into "an unsown land" (Jer. 2:2).</p><p>It is this act of redemption by God that establishes the Covenant between Israel and God. Prior to the Exodus, the covenantal relationship existed only between God and individuals-for example, between God and Abraham. Passover marks the beginning of the relationship between God and the Jews as a people. God's claim to the Covenant lies in His having fulfilled His promise to bring us out of Egypt. Having redeemed us, God promises: "And I will take you to be My people, and I will be your God. And you shall know that 1, the Lord, am your God who freed you from the burdens of the Egyptians" (Exod. 6:7).</p><p>This covenantal relationship lies at the heart of the celebration of Passover. We rejoice for the past liberation from Egypt and for other redemptions by God since then. And because of the fulfillment of past promises, we anticipate at Passover the future final redemption. We create a special role for the prophet Elijah at the seder (see below) as the symbol of our faith in the redemption soon to come.</p><p>Because it is the crucial event that marks the beginning of our sacred history, the Exodus is referred to repeatedly in Jewish liturgy and thought. For example, the shema (the central prayer in Jewish liturgy) concludes "I, the Lord, am your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I the Lord your God" (Num. 15:41). At Passover we are commanded to tell the story of the Exodus. This commandment, unique to this holiday, leads us not simply to remember the Exodus but to expand upon the tale, to explore its complexities and develop its meaning. Thus the Haggadah, the liturgy we use at the seder, states:</p><p>In every generation, each person should feel as though she or he were redeemed from Egypt, as it is said: "You shall tell your children on that day saying, 'It is because of what the Lord did for me when I went free out of Egypt.' For the Holy One redeemed not only our ancestors; He redeemed us with them."</p><p>The uniqueness of Passover is encapsulated in the above passage. It teaches us that Jewish history is also a timeless present, that Passover is not simply a commemoration of an important event in our past-analogous to the Fourth of July or Bastille Day-but an event in which we participated and in which we continue to participate. We are meant to reexperience the slavery and the redemption that occurs in each day of our lives. It is our own story, not just some ancient history that we retell at Passover.</p><p>To relive the experience, we are commanded to observe three rituals:</p><p>1. To tell the story of the Exodus. As the Torah states: "Remember this day, on which you went free from Egypt, the house of bondage, how the Lord freed you from it with a...</p>&#34;Help[s] readers understand more fully the meaning of our holidays and thereby to observe these festivals...with a greater devotion and joy.&#34;-- Rabbi Alexander M.

After ex-detective Nick Bottom's wife died in a car accident, he went under the flash to be with her; he's lost his job, his teenage son, and his livelihood as a result.<br><br>Nick may be a lost soul but he's still a good cop, so he is hired to investigate the murder of a top governmental advisor's son. This flashback-addict becomes the one man who may be able to change the course of an entire nation turning away from the future to live in the past.<br></p><p>Dan Simmons is the award-winning author of several novels, including the New York Times bestsellers <em>Olympos</em> and <em>The Terror</em>. He lives in Colorado.&#39;This is Simmons doing detective noir with an SF sheen ... Simmons has, as ever, created a compelling, believable cast of characters, but it&#39;s not really Nick Bottom&#39;s travails that make this such a startling read. His trajectory is tightly plotted and there&#39;s an emotional undertow to his actions that&#39;s easy to empathise with, sure, but it&#39;s the world Simmons has made that&#39;s the thing here, a world that sits right next to ours and might actually be our world if we&#39;re not too careful - and it&#39;s not too late. This is a provocative, frightening book ... Flashback is a fascinating read and many, no doubt, will be outraged at what it suggests. It&#39;s a book that will stay with you days after you finish it, chewing over its implications and precedents; but it&#39;s also a thrilling detective novel with a grand compelling mystery at its centre and more heart than you might think&#39; SFX. &#39;...nothing will prepare you for Flashback, a book as relentlessly compelling and unsettling as it punishing to read ... Simmons accomplishes this mood so well that it&#39;s difficult to fault the book for essentially excelling at creating atmosphere and complex history for this universe&#39; Sci-Fi Now.</p><h2>Wimsey Family: A Fragmentary History Compiled from Correspondence With Dorothy L.

In Daniel Stein, Interpreter, Daniel&#39;s ability and willingness to communicate with all cultures, to translate across linguistic and cultural divides, assures his freedom and stands as a symbol of love, humanity and tolerance.</p><p><b>Ludmila Ulitskaya</b> was born in western Russia and worked as a scientist before becoming Repertory Director of the Hebrew Theater of Moscow. She is hailed as Russia's bestselling literary novelist.<br><br><b>Arch Tait</b> has a PhD in Russian literature from Cambridge. He has translated the work of many leading Russian writers.In her fourth book to be translated into English (for which Tait won the PEN Literature in Translation award), Ulitskaya weaves a dense narrative of the lives touched by Br. Daniel Stein. Ulitskaya's (The Funeral Party) ambitious effort is a kind of case file composed of conversations, lectures, sermons, and excerpts from letters, diaries, and news articles. The story begins in 1942 in Belorussia, where Stein, a clandestine Polish Jew pressed into service by the Germans, secretly helps 300 Jews escape the ghetto. After the war he converts to Catholicism, becomes a priest, and moves to Israel, where he influences the lives of many over a number of years. With warmth and intelligence, Stein addresses life's great challenges and the complexities of faith, though not everyone is pleased with his unorthodox views. Ulitskaya's story of one man's devotion to bridging the divide between Christianity and Judaism in the Holy Land raises complex theological, moral, and emotional questions. Sympathetic characters (many drawn from real life) and a layered structure allows the tension of these myriad lives to emerge naturally. (Apr.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

If it were, more companies would be good at it. But being competent at managing your inventory isn't all that difficult either. It just requires that you invest the time to develop an understanding of the factors that should be affecting your inventory management decisions. Then use this understanding to start to put together the calculations and decision logic you will use to manage your inventory. <br> <b>Explained</b>. Calculations for forecasting, lot sizing, and safety stock are well known to the inventory management community, but are generally not understood to the level necessary to effectively use them. This lack of understanding results in incomplete calculations, incorrect inputs, flawed logic, or a fall-back to less effective, keep-it-simple approaches. <br> <b>Inventory Management Explained</b> helps readers build a solid understanding of the key planning aspects of inventory management. It does this by clearly explaining what inventory management is, but then goes well beyond typical inventory management books by tearing apart the calculations and logic we use in inventory management and exposing the hidden (or not so hidden) flaws and limitations. It then builds on this by showing readers how they can use their understanding of inventory management and their specific business needs to modify these calculations or develop their own calculations to more effectively manage their inventory. The emphasis on practical solutions means readers can actually use what they've learned.<br> <b>For those new to inventory management</b>, the author includes highly detailed explanations and numerous examples. Instead of archaic mathematical syntax, the author explains the calculations in plain English and uses Excel formulas and spreadsheet examples for many of them.<br> <b>For the experienced practitioner</b>, the author provides insights and a level of detail they likely have not previously experienced. Overall, Inventory Management Explained does actually explain inventory management, and in doing so, exposes the good, the bad, and the ugly aspects of it. But more importantly, it leaves the readers knowing enough to be able to start making smart decisions about how they manage their inventory. </p> <p> <br> <b>Topics covered include:</b><br> - History-based forecasting methods including Exponential Smoothing, Adaptive Smoothing, Moving Average, and Weighted Moving Average.<br> - Seasonality Indexes , Trend Adjustments, and Forecast Overrides.<br> - Excel's Regression Analysis tool, Forecast Function, and Solver Add-in.<br> - Why Keep-it-simple methods for calculating safety stock don't work. <br> - The Normal Distribution model and why it applies to safety stock calculations.<br> - How to modify your safety stock calculation to account for your forecast, lead time, and order cycles.<br> - What EOQ is, where it came from, and what all the numbers mean.<br> - What goes into Order Cost and Carrying Cost.<br> - Setting up an order quantity calculation in Excel that takes into account Quantity Discounts. <br> - Dealing with seasonality and trend in your order quantity calculations. <br> - Periodic Review, Fixed Order Point, Min-Max, Multi-bin, Kanban, and ordering systems that directly utilize your forecast.<br> - The real difference between Push Systems and Pull Systems. <br> - Materials Requirements Planning (MRP) and Distribution Requirements Planning (DRP) <br> - Gross Requirements, Net Requirements, Planned Orders, Bills of Materials, Routings, Master Production Scheduling (MPS) <br> - How to put together an effective Fair-Share Distribution system.<br> - Fill Rates, On-Time Delivery, ABC stratification, Out-of-stock analysis, Excess and Obsolete inventory.</p></p><p></p><h2>On Christmas Eve</h2><p>Unable to sleep on Christmas Eve, four children creep downstairs to see the tree, their stockings, their wrapped gifts, and to hear the singing of the carolers</p><p>Margaret Wise Brown, author of <i>Goodnight Moon</i> and <i>The Runaway Bunny,</i> is one of the best-selling children's book authors of all time.

Brown's (Goodnight Moon) text balances heart-pounding, childlike excitement with graceful imagery ("The Christmas tree was all there, trimmed with shiny glints of red and blue and green that flickered in the dying firelight"). In Calder's (The Christmas House) soft, grainy paintings, quaint and beautifully appointed houses nestle in the hush of a nighttime snowfall evoking suburban New England.

Federal Election Commission-</i>trust in our government has reached an all-time low. More than ever before, Americans believe that money buys results in Congress, and that business interests wield control over our legislature.<br><br> With heartfelt urgency and a keen desire for righting wrongs, Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig takes a clear-eyed look at how we arrived at this crisis: how fundamentally good people, with good intentions, have allowed our democracy to be co-opted by outside interests, and how this exploitation has become entrenched in the system. Rejecting simple labels and reductive logic-and instead using examples that resonate as powerfully on the Right as on the Left-Lessig seeks out the root causes of our situation. He plumbs the issues of campaign financing and corporate lobbying, revealing the human faces and follies that have allowed corruption to take such a foothold in our system. He puts the issues in terms that nonwonks can understand, using real-world analogies and real human stories. And ultimately he calls for widespread mobilization and a new Constitutional Convention, presenting achievable solutions for regaining control of our corrupted-but redeemable-representational system. In this way, Lessig plots a roadmap for returning our republic to its intended greatness. <br><br> While America may be divided, Lessig vividly champions the idea that we can succeed if we accept that corruption is our common enemy and that we must find a way to fight against it. In REPUBLIC, LOST, he not only makes this need palpable and clear-he gives us the practical and intellectual tools to do something about it.</p><p>Lawrence Lessig is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership at Harvard Law School, and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University. Prior to rejoining the Harvard faculty, Lessig was a professor at Stanford Law School, where he founded the school's Center for Internet and Society, and at the University of Chicago. He clerked for Judge Richard Posner on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals and Justice Antonin Scalia on the United States Supreme Court.<br><br>Lessig serves on the Board of Creative Commons, MapLight, Brave New Film Foundation, The American Academy, Berlin, AXA Research Fund and iCommons.org, and on the advisory board of the Sunlight Foundation. He is a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Association, and has received numerous awards, including the Free Software Foundation's Freedom Award, Fastcase 50 Award and being named one of Scientific American's Top 50 Visionaries.<br><br>Lessig holds a BA in economics and a BS in management from the University of Pennsylvania, an MA in philosophy from Cambridge, and a JD from Yale.<b>Praise for REPUBLIC, LOST</b><b><br></b>As an academic, Lessig has the research chops to find the anecdotes that best fit the narrative case he's making, and to lay them out in wonderful detail. But his real gift is in the art of stringing them together into a story. That means that this book is as persuasive as it is enjoyable to read.&#x2015;<b>Alesh Houdek</b>, <b><i><i>The Atlantic</i></i></b><br><br>REPUBLIC, LOST is a powerful reminder that this problem goes deeper than poor legislative tactics or bad character.

A welcome new angle on the subject of our culture's obsession with personal appearance, <i>Hope in a Jar</i> reveals that the American beauty industry was founded on more than just clever advertising or patriarchal oppression. "Not only tools of deception and illusion," says historian Kathy Peiss of our culture's powders and pastes, "these little jars tell a rich history of women's ambition, pleasure, and community."<p> The early entrepreneurs in the beauty business were often women, most of them as skilled at reinventing themselves as at making over their customers. Elizabeth Arden came from a poor Canadian family but remade her image into one of "upper-crust Protestant femininity" in order to sell her products. Madame Walker, one of the many African American women who were able to find careers in the beauty industry, rose from laundry lady to head of a small cosmetic empire. Indeed, Peiss finds, the beauty industry was one of the first to bring a substantial number of women a decent income.</p><p> For American consumers, the marketing of makeup has long stirred issues of race, class, and morality. Peiss addresses in particular how makeup has long been marketed in ways that assert the superiority of "white" features and skin over that of other races, and how African-Americans and other minorities in the cosmetic industry have dealt with this issue.</p><p> This is a well-researched, fascinating book that is more than a picture of the business of American beauty; it is a window into over a hundred years of American women's history. <i>--Maria Dolan</i></p>Kathy Peiss, author of the highly praised Cheap Amusements, teaches history at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst and has written widely on women&#39;s history and culture.

A.W. Tozer s interest and appeal concerning the Holy Spirit was not academic, but devotional, inspirational and practical.</p><p><b></b><p><b>Know the Spirit and His Presence</b><i></i></p><p><i>Tozer on the Holy Spirit</i>&nbsp;is a 365-day devotional that unearths the wonder of the Holy Spirit. Tozer was a man who thirsted for the Spirit of God, who prayed often and shunned distraction so that he might drink Him in more steadily. In these daily meditations on Scripture, Tozer will inspire you to do the same. According to Tozer, the Spirit is neglected by the modern church-"buried dynamite," so to speak. But were the believer to know the Spirit-intimately and accurately-she would know freedom from stagnancy. She would know power and life.</p><b>A.W. TOZER</b> began his lifelong pursuit of God at the age of seventeen after hearing a street preacher in Akron, Ohio. A self-taught theologian, Tozer was a pastor, writer and editor whose powerful use of words continues to grip the intellect and stir the soul of today's reader. Among his best-loved books are the classics <i>The Pursuit of God</i> and <i>The Attributes of God</i>.</p><h2>Ambrose Bierce: Alone in Bad Company</h2><p>When 71-year-old Ambrose Bierce disappeared into revolution-torn Mexico in 1913, he probably had more enemies than any man alive. This was only fair; he had labored long and hard to make himself hateful, and in the end he succeeded all too well. The targets of his printed abuse ranged from the mightiest and most rapacious robber baron to the meekest and least offensive would-be poet, although Bierce reserved his sharpest barbs for "that immortal ass, the average man." <br><br>Bierce himself was anything but average. As the only American writer of any stature to fight in and survive the Civil War, his groundbreaking short stories of that war, including his most famous work, 'An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge', have had a lasting influence on every subsequent American author dealing with war. <br><br>Profoundly disillusioned by his wartime experiences, Bierce spent the next fifty years struggling to disillusion his fellow Americans of their own cherished ideals -- romantic, religious, or political. In such sepulchrally dark works as The Devil&#x2019;s Dictionary, he fought a one-man guerrilla war against the smug forces of the status quo. Not for nothing was he called among other things "Bitter Bierce", "the Devil's Lexicographer" and "the Wickedest Man in San Francisco". <br><br>Frequently criticized for the intensity of his personal invective, Bierce once advised his detractors to "continue selling shoes, selling pancakes, or selling themselves. As for me I sell abuse." In this perceptive, insightful biography, Roy Morris, Jr., accounts for both the influential art that Ambrose Bierce made from such a harsh and unforgiving vision and the high price he had to pay for it in loneliness, rancor, and spiritual isolation. <br><br>A lively and compelling portrait of one of the most acerbic and distinctive voices in American literature, Ambrose Bierce: Alone in Bad Company is a clear-eyed but sympathetic account of a complex individual at odds with his country, his family, his times, and himself.</p><p>compelling portrait of one of the most acerbic and distinctive voices in American literature, this book is a clear-eyed but sympathetic account of a complex individual at odds with his country, his family, his times, and himself.<br><strong>Roy Morris, Jr.</strong>, is the editor of <em>America's Civil War</em> and the author of <em>Sheridan: The Life and Wars of General Phil Sheridan</em>.

We not only plan to live longer, but expect to enjoy a superior standard of physical and emotional health for longer than any previous generation. Leading an active and purposeful life no longer stops at the outdated 65-year mark of retirement, but continues well into what was once termed "old age." With these changing attitudes comes the need for new conceptualizations of what it means to grow old.<br><br> In a groundbreaking book, Robert Hill, a psychologist, professor, and leading researcher in geriatric care, rethinks the traditional ideas we have of aging by offering us a new framework from which to understand the nature of growing old. <em>Positive Aging</em> offers a more innovative model of old age that focuses on achieving and fostering a positive mindset. In doing so, Hill not only explores the social and psychological trends of aging in the 21st century, but offers an illuminating examination of how advances in the science of gerontology influence the phenomenology of growing old.<br><br> Written for all those concerned about their own course of aging as well as the practitioner who provides mental health services to older adults, <em>Positive Aging</em> begins with a review of the term "aging" itself, its history and its changing meaning. Hill then delves into the many lifestyle choices we can make to improve our happiness as we grow older. Traditional theories of adult development and how <em>Positive Aging</em> plays into them are examined; successful, normal, impaired, and diseased trajectories of age-related decline are defined and explored; and useful strategies are provided for coping with common old-age issues&#x2015;including cognitive deficits, depression, anxiety, and psychological barriers to happiness. Hill also covers important late-life concerns such as the role <em>Positive Aging</em> plays in physical disability, caregiving, grief, bereavement, death, and spirituality and meaning-based counseling. Along the way, poignant case studies help elucidate and contextualize the arguments, and keep the discussion rooted in very tangible, human terms.<br><br> Ushering in an era of new understanding of what it means to grow older, <em>Positive Aging</em> is an enlightening guidebook for consumers navigating such uncertain, and often worrisome terrain, as well as an invaluable resource for clinicians working with this growing population. By combining a novel approach to human aging in the contemporary world with specific suggestions and ideas to optimize that process, this book promises to help all of us cope with the vicissitudes of growing older to continue to get the most out of living.</p><p>Dr. Robert Hill has studied issues of normal and pathological aging internationally at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden and in the Netherlands through a Fulbright Fellowship at Maastricht University where he developed and wrote Positive Aging. A licensed psychologist in the State of Utah and the Chair of the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Utah, he holds a diplomate in Counseling Psychology from the American Board of Professional Psychology.A wonderful addition to the literature on how practitioners can assist those who are aging. -- <i><i>PsycCRITIQUES</i></i><br><br>Any...in the mental health industry will find...useful and inspiring...Lay readers will find this holds much hope for an aging population. -- <i><i>California Bookwatch</i></i></p><h2>The Cloud of Unknowing: The Classic of Medieval Mysticism</h2><p>An exploration of the nature of reality, mysticism begins with the individual struggle toward a clear vision and culminates in a transformed consciousness. This marvelous guide to the contemplative life originated with the reflection of an unknown fourteenth-century priest who believed that a "cloud of unknowing" separates people from God. This cloud, he maintained, cannot be penetrated by intellect &#x2014;only by love.<br><i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i> offers an approach to contemplative life that finds holiness at a level deeper than physical experience and beyond language or image. The author advises placing all thought and mental imagery behind a metaphorical "cloud of forgetting" while seeking to love the divine. Hidden from the infinite consciousness by a "cloud of unknowing," divine love can be reached through monologistic prayer &#x2014; a single-word prayer, like a mantra, that assists in abandoning all extraneous thought. Seekers can thus attain an inner silence, where they may "be still and know the sacred."<br>The author's spiritual gifts, combined with his humorous and straightforward approach, offer a view of divinity that never loses the common touch. Written in everyday language and edited by a popular authority on mysticism, this venerable work can be understood and appreciated by any reader.</p><p>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.<p>Written by an anonymous English monk during the late fourteenth century, <em>The Cloud of Unknowing</em> is a sublime expression of what separates God from humanity and is widely regarded as a hallmark of Western literature and spirituality. A work of simplicity, courage, and lucidity, it is a contemplative classic on the deep mysteries of faith.</p><p> "Lift up your heart to God with a humble impulse of love and have himself as your aim, not any of his goods ... Set yourself to rest in this darkness, always crying out after him whom you love. For if you are to experience him or to see him at all, insofar as it is possible here, it must always be in this cloud and in this darkness." &#x2013;&#x2013; <em>The Cloud of Unknowing</em></p></p><h2>Picturing Men: A Century of Male Relationships in Everyday American Photography</h2><p>Ibson&#39;s analysis focuses on the history of male intimacy and how these everyday photographs challenge conventional boundaries between erotic and platonic, homosexuality and heterosexuality. He explores the photos as symbols of male association from a time when America was far more gender-segregated than it is today, and men felt no anxiety about showing their affection for one another. The images present men of different ages, classes, and races in a range of settings: posed in photographers&#39; studios, on beaches, in lumber camps, on farms, on ships, indoors and out. Ibson concludes his study with images from the 1950s, in which the men begin to show a rigid and limited set of expressions.</p><p>John Ibson is professor of American studies at California State University, Fullerton.</p><h2>Moses Goes to a Concert</h2><p>Moses and his school friends are deaf, but like most children, they have a lot to say. They communicate in American Sigh Language, using visual signs and facial expressions. This is called signing. And even though they can't hear, they can enjoy many activities through their other senses. Today, Moses and his classmates are going to a concert. Their teacher, Mr. Samuels, has two surprises in store for them, to make this particular concert a special event.<br><br>Isaac Millman tells Moses's story in pictures and written English, and in American Sign Language (ASL), introducing hearing children to the signs for some of the key words and ideas. At the end of the book are two full conversations in sign language and a page showing the hand alphabet.<br><br>You can learn sign language, too.<br></p><p>Isaac Millman also wrote and illustrated <i>Moses Goes to School</i>, a Junior Library Guild Selection. He lives in New York City.Millman's story, illustrated in delicate watercolors, ought to pop open a few young eyes (and perhaps some adult eyes as well). Moses and his school chums, all deaf, are off to a young people's concert. They take their seats up front, where a row of percussion instruments is arrayed between them and the orchestra. When the percussionist appears, she is in her stocking feet; she is deaf, and will feel the music through the floor. Moses's teacher hands out balloons that they will hold in their laps and that will help them feel the music. After the concert the percussionist, using sign language, gives the students a little inspirational talk, which Moses delivers to his parents later that evening. The power of Millman's book comes from the simple fact that he levels the playing field; of course deaf children go to concerts, but conveying how they enjoy music removes yet one more barrier between those who can hear and those who cannot. Moses also appears in inset boxes, signing comments aimed at readers and encouraging them to attempt signs. A few spreads are given over entirely to signed conversations, with effectively diagrammed hand movements and facial expressions. The final page illustrates the signed letters of the alphabet.

This humorous novel is set in a Japanese-owned America, where everything is run for profit. By the author of Slaughterhouse 5.</p><p>Kurt Vonnegut is a unique voice in the American canon &#x2014; a writer whose works are hard to categorize, often straddling the space between literature and science fiction, and filled with cutting satire and dark humor. Like Mark Twain before him, Vonnegut's reputation and impact on American writing and reading will continue to grow steadily and increase in relevance as new insights are made. Vonnegut was born in 1922 in Indianapolis, and studied at the University of Chicago and the University of Tennessee. In the Second World War, he became a German prisoner of war and was present during the bombing of Dresden. This experience provided inspiration for his most successful and influential novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. Vonnegut &#x2014; admired as much for his views and his &#x201c;Vonnegutisms&#x201d; as for his publications &#x2014; wrote extensively in many forms, including novels, short stories, essays, plays, articles, speeches, and correspondence, some of which was published posthumously.While awaiting trial for an initially unspecified crime, Vietnam vet and college professor Eugene Debs Hartke realizes that he has killed exactly as many people as he has had sex with, a coincidence that causes him to doubt his atheism. According to PW , "The cumulative power of the novel is considerable, revealing Vonnegut at his fanciful and playful best." <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Knitting Classic Style: 35 Modern Designs Inspired by Fashion&#39;s Archives</h2><p>Classic projects that will maintain their appeal for many years instead of just one or two fashion seasons <br>Elegant yet retro-cool projects<br><br>In fashion, one day you&#x2019;re in, the next day you&#x2019;re out . . . and the day after that, you&#x2019;re back in again.

But this story is so dense with rich characterizations as to seem a new genre. Graham nests her murder plots in gentle social satire; this one pokes affectionate fun at the fringes of mysticism and New Age cults. But her characters are not stereotypes; each flawed and foolish one finds a different way to tug at the reader&#39;s heartstrings. Hugh Ross&#39;s performance adds luster to an already sparkling book. His narration sounds delightfully spontaneous, and his mildly exaggerated vocal characterizations (including a bravura turn as the Valkyric cello-playing priestess) perfectly match the author&#39;s style.

Disparaging the commodification of fantasy, Beagle (The Last Unicorn) uses 19 stories and two essays to demonstrate that unique works of imagination are still appearing on both sides of the ostensible "separation of fantasy from actual literature." The all-star cast includes genre powerhouses (Maureen F. McHugh, Terry Bisson), mainstream favorites (Yann Martel, T.C. Boyle), and incorrigible line-straddlers (Jonathan Lethem, Stephen Millhauser). Concluding essays by Ursula Le Guin and David Hartwell can seem strident in their condemnation of "nostalgic, conservative, pastoral, and optimistic" epic fantasy. But in tales like Millhauser's "The Barnum Museum," which itself encapsulates the entire discussion of how to view the literature of the fantastic, there is a sense of frivolity and freedom that permits this anthology to "elude the mundane, and to achieve... beauty and exaltation." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It may have been FEAR of tomorrow, FEAR of failure, FEAR of the unknown or FEAR of spiders. Perhaps it was FEAR working in us as anxiety.

Author of over 15 best-selling titles in the Ghost Story series for adults, Barbara is now turning her attention to young readers.This exceptional volume bears witness to the movement of embroidery out of the parlor and into the artist's studio. Chicago embroiderer Smith, whose own constructions feature spray paint, a variety of threads and machine embroidery, interviews forward-looking needleworkers and introduces their startling productions, explaining not only how the artists compose their pieces but why they choose particular media. Some use traditional forms and subvert them, as in Caroline Dahl's Terror Sampler II , emblazoned "You've made my life a living burning hell." Others incorporate space-age materials, as in Patricia Malarcher's Mylar quilts and prayer rugs. And many benefit from technologies--e.g., color-photocopying and heat-transferring. Most, though not all, are boldly three-dimensional, calling on a heady mix of techniques. A plethora of examples (240 photos, 209 of them in color) is inspiration enough, but Smith also explores creative issues (e.g., generating ideas) and suggestions for new approaches (e.g., for overcoming blocks).

In Origo's case, she managed to add light and color to everything she touched and left for posterity a legacy of work, biography, autobiography, and literary criticism, that have become recognized as classics of their kind.<br><p><br>She was born into a wealthy and long-established Long Island family, the Cuttings, but her talented and beloved father (who resembled, more than a little, a character right out of Henry James) died of consumption when she was only nine. She spent the following years traveling the world with her mother and an extensive entourage, settling finally at the Villa Medici at Fiesole and entering into the privileged world of wealthy Anglo-Florentine expatriates whose likes included the Berensons, Harold Acton, Janet Ross, and Edith Wharton, and whose petty bickering, and pettier politics, had a profound influence on how she spent her life.<br></p><p><br>Her marriage to Antonio Origo, a wealthy landowner and sportsman, was as much a reaction to this insular world as it was a surprise to her family and friends. Together they purchased, and single-handedly revived, an extensive, arid valley in Tuscany called Val d'Orcia, rebuilding the farmsteads and the manor house. Although clearly sympathetic to Mussolini's land use policies, they sided firmly with the Allies during World War II, taking considerable risks in protecting children, sheltering partisans, and repatriating Allied prisoners-of-war to their units.<br></p><p><br>Caroline Moorehead has made extensive use of unpublished letters, diaries, and papers to write what will surely be considered the definitive biography of this remarkable woman. She has limned a figure who was brave, industrious, and fiercely independent, but hardly saintly. What emerges is a portrait of one of the more intriguing, attractive, and intelligent women of the last century.</p></p><p>Caroline Moorehead is a biographer, writer and reviewer who has worked in broadcasting and is a specialist on human rights. She grew up in Italy in Florence and Rome and now lives in London.*Starred Review* Eagerly exchanging an existence of idle privilege and social intrigue for one of hard work and literary distinction, Origo led a life characterized by vitality and commitment. Born in 1902 into a wealthy American family, she and her British mother permanently left the U.S. after the untimely death of her father in 1910. Traveling extensively throughout Europe, they eventually settled outside of Florence, becoming prominent members of the stuffy Anglo-Florentine community of expatriates. Asserting her trademark independence, she married Antonio Origo, the illegitimate son of a cavalry officer-sculptor. Together Antonio and Iris purchased and totally revitalized an arid Tuscan valley and renovated a crumbling estate. With virtually no experience and few practical skills, they transformed themselves into agrarian pioneers and their extensive acreage into a prosperous working community supporting more than 200 people. During the war years, they quietly supported the Allies, offering refuge to countless numbers of partisans and prisoners of war. In addition to these accomplishments, Iris also buried one child and raised two more, conducted several heart-wrenching extramarital affairs, and distinguished herself as both a biographer and a literary critic. Moorehead has exquisitely captured the energy and the essence of an aristocrat resolutely committed to her land, her craft, and her nontraditional lifestyle. A magnificent biography, so absorbing and so full of fascinating characters and descriptive details that it reads like fiction. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In a shabby hotel off the place Clichy, the course of the French resistance is about to change. German tanks are rolling toward Moscow. Stalin has issued a decree: all partisan operatives are to strike behind enemy lines--from Kiev to Brittany.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set in the back streets of Paris and deep in occupied France, Red Gold moves with quiet and pervasive menace as predators from the dark edge of the war--arms dealers, lawyers, spies, and assassins--emerge from the shadows of the Parisian underworld.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their midst is Jean Casson, once a producer of gangster films, now living on a few francs a day and hunted by the Gestapo. As the German occupation tightens, Casson is drawn into an ill-fated mission: running guns to combat units of the French Communist party. Their NKVD contact, a former Comintern operative named Weiss--his seventeenth name--begins to orchestrate a series of attacks against the Germans. Reprisals are brutal. Fear spreads through the city. At last the real resistance has begun.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red Gold masterfully recreates the duplicitous world of the French resistance in the worst days of World War II.</p><p>If you enjoy mysteries set against the rich background of World War II Europe (Philip Kerr's Berlin Noir trilogy and the fine French series by J. Robert Janes are prime examples), you should also know about Alan Furst. He began by writing such excellent, original books as <i>Dark Star</i> and <i>Night Soldiers</i>, all set in Eastern Europe. The locale then moved to Paris for <i>The World at Night</i>, where we first met the enigmatic film producer and reluctant Resistance hero Jean Casson.<p> Casson returns in fascinating form in <i>Red Gold</i>, washing up broke and depressed in his home city, now totally ground down by its German occupiers. Recruited by a sympathetic cop, Casson joins a group of officers working undercover inside the Vichy government to help de Gaulle. Casson's job is to convince justifiably skeptical French communists to cooperate; to do so he must organize a complicated, extremely dangerous transfer of weapons. There's nothing glamorous about the work or its result, but Furst is such a persuasive writer that we come to realize what a success it is for Casson just to stay alive. This innovative and gripping novel eloquently transports us back to a different era and a different world. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Advance Praise for Alan Furst's RED GOLD<p><br>"Furst has established himself as a modern master of WWII espionage: not since the doors were still open at Rick's Cafe American has the pungent smoke from Gauloise cigarettes filled a room with such a heady mix of trench-coated intrigue and romance by searchlight...

The door opens in the wall, and I go in.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The light in that room is clear and calm, falling from many small skylights of thick glass in the high ceiling. It&#x2019;s a very long room, with shelves down its wall, and books on the shelves. It&#x2019;s my room, and I&#x2019;ve always known it. Ista and Sosta and Gudit don&#x2019;t. They don&#x2019;t even know it&#x2019;s there. They never come to these corridors far in the back of the house. I pass the Waylord&#x2019;s door to come here, but he&#x2019;s sick and lame and stays in his rooms. The secret room is my secret, the place where I can be alone, and not scolded and bothered, and not afraid.<br>&nbsp;The memory isn&#x2019;t of one time I went there, but many. I remember how big the reading table looked to me then, and how high the bookshelves were. I liked to get under the table and build a kind of wall or shelter with some of the books. I pretended to be a bear cub in its den. I felt safe there. I always put the books back exactly where they belonged on the shelves; that was important. I stayed in the lighter part of the room, near the door that&#x2019;s not a door. I didn&#x2019;t like the farther end, where it grows dark and the ceiling comes down lower. In my mind I called that the shadow end, and I almost always stayed away from it. But even my fear of the shadow end was part of my secret, my kingdom of solitude. And it was mine alone, until one day when I was nine.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sosta had been scolding me for some stupid thing that wasn&#x2019;t my fault, and when I was rude back to her she called me &#x201c;sheep hair,&#x201d; which put me in a fury. I couldn&#x2019;t hit her because her arms were longer and she could hold me off, so I bit her hand. Then her mother, my bymother Ista, scolded me and cuffed me. Furious, I ran to the back part of the house, to the dark corridor, and opened the door and went into the secret room. I was going to stay there till Ista and Sosta thought I&#x2019;d run away and been taken as a slave and was gone forever, and then they&#x2019;d be sorry for scolding unjustly and cuffing and calling me names. I rushed into the secret room all hot and full of tears and rage&#x2014; and there, in the strange clear light of that place, stood the Waylord with a book in his hands.<br>&nbsp;He was startled, too. He came at me, fierce, his arm raised as if to strike. I stood like a stone. I could not breathe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped short. &#x201c;Memer! How did you come here?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the place where the door is when it&#x2019;s open, but of course nothing was there but the wall.<br>&nbsp;I still couldn&#x2019;t breathe or speak.<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;I left it open,&#x201d; he said, without believing what he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I shook my head.<br>&nbsp;Finally I was able to whisper, &#x201c;I know how.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;His face was shocked and amazed, but after a while it changed, and he said, &#x201c;Decalo.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;I nodded.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother&#x2019;s name was Decalo Galva.<br>&nbsp;I want to tell of her, but I can&#x2019;t remember her. Or I do but the memory won&#x2019;t go into words. Being held tight, jostling, a good smell in the darkness of the bed, a rough red cloth, a voice which I can&#x2019;t hear but it&#x2019;s only just out of hearing. I used to think if I could hold still and listen hard enough, I&#x2019;d hear her voice.<br>&nbsp;She was a Galva by blood and by house. She was head housekeeper for Sulter Galva, Waylord of Ansul, an honorable and responsible position. In Ansul there were no serfs or slaves then; we were citizens, householders, free people. My mother Decalo was in charge of all the people who worked in Galvamand. My bymother Ista, the cook, liked to tell us about how big the household used to be, back then, how many people Decalo had to look after. Ista herself had two kitchen assistants every day, and three helpers for the big dinners for visiting notables; there were four housecleaners, and the handyman, and a groom and stableboy for the horses, eight horses in the stable, some to ride and some to drive. There were quite a few relatives and old people living in the house. Ista&#x2019;s mother lived up over the kitchens, the Waylord&#x2019;s mother lived in the Master&#x2019;s rooms upstairs. The Waylord himself was always travelling up and down the Ansul Coast from town to town to meet with the other waylords, sometimes in the saddle, sometimes in a carriage with a retinue. There was a smithy in the west court in those days, and the driver and postboy lived on the top floor of the carriage house, always ready to go out with the Waylord on his rounds. &#x201c;Oh it was all busy and abustle,&#x201d; Ista says. &#x201c;The old days! The good days!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I ran through the silent corridors past the ruined rooms, I used to try to imagine those days, the good days. I used to pretend, when I swept the doorways, that I was making ready for guests who&#x2019;d come through them wearing fine clothes and shoes. I used to go up to the Master&#x2019;s rooms and imagine how they&#x2019;d looked clean and warm and furnished. I&#x2019;d kneel in the windowseat there to look out through the clear, small-paned window over the roofs of the city to the mountain.<br>&nbsp;The name of my city and all the coast north of it, Ansul, means &#x201c;Looking at Sul&#x201d;&#x2014; the great mountain, last and highest of the five peaks of Manva, the land across the straits. From the seafront and from all the western windows of the city you can see white Sul above the water, and the clouds it gathers round it as if they were its dreams.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew the city had been called Ansul the Wise and Beautiful for its university and library, its towers and arcaded courts, its canals and arched bridges and the thousand little marble temples of the street-gods. But the Ansul of my childhood was a broken city of ruins, hunger, and fear.&nbsp;Ansul was a protectorate of Sundraman, but that great nation was busy fighting over its border with Loaman and kept no troops here to defend us. Though rich in goods and farmland, Ansul had long fought no wars. Our well-armed merchant fleet kept pirates from the south from harrying the coast, and since Sundraman enforced an alliance with us long ago, we had had no enemies by land. So when an army of Alds, the people of the deserts of Asudar, invaded us, they swept over the hills of Ansul like wildfire. Their army broke into the city and went through the streets murdering, looting, and raping. My mother Decalo, caught in the street coming from the market, was taken by soldiers and raped. Then the soldiers who had her were attacked by citizens, and in the fighting she managed to get away and get home to Galvamand.<br>&nbsp;Copyright � 2006 by Ursula K. Le Guin<br>All rights reserved.

For too long Hedren&#x2019;s story has been told by others through whispered gossip and tabloid headlines. Now, Hedren sets the record straight, recalling how a young and virtuous Lutheran girl from small-town Minnesota became a worldwide legend&#x2014;as one of the most famous Hitchcock girls, as an unwavering animal activist, and as the matriarch of a powerful Hollywood dynasty that includes her movie star daughter Melanie Griffith, and rising star Dakota Johnson, her granddaughter.</p><p>For the first time, Hedren digs deep into her complicated relationship with the man who discovered her talent, director Alfred Hitchcock, the benefactor who would become a repulsive and controlling director who contractually controlled her every move. She speaks openly about the dark pain she endured working with him on their most famous collaborations, <em>The Birds</em> and <em>Marnie</em>, and finding the courage she needed to break away.</p><p>Hedren&#x2019;s incandescent spirit shines through as she talks about working with the great Charlie Chaplin, sharing the screen with some of the most esteemed actors in Hollywood, her experiences on some of the most intriguing and troubling film sets&#x2014;including filming <em>Roar</em>, one of the most dangerous movies ever made&#x2014;and the struggles of being a single mother&#x2014;balancing her dedication to her work and her devotion to her daughter&#x2014;and her commitment to helping animals. </p><p>Filled with sixteen pages of beautiful photos, <em>Tippi</em> is a rare and fascinating look at a private woman&#x2019;s remarkable life no celebrity aficionado can miss.</p></p><p><p>For decades, Tippi Hedren&#x2019;s luminous beauty radiated from the silver screen, enchanting moviegoers and cementing her among Hollywood&#x2019;s elite. From Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s <em>The Birds</em> to <em>Roar, </em>one of the most controversial movies ever made, Tippi Hedren has had few dull moments, and though stories about her have spread through whispered gossip and tabloid headlines, she has never told the full tale of her astonishing life in her own words -until now.</p><p>In <em>Tippi,</em> this cinematic icon pulls back the veil on her storied life, detailing her rise from humble beginnings in Depression-era small-town Minnesota to becoming the matriarch of a powerful Hollywood dynasty that includes her movie-star daughter, Melanie Griffith, and her granddaughter Dakota Johnson. This extraordinary career started simply, with a chance meeting that led to her early modeling career&#x2014;first in department-store fashion shows, then working with Eileen Ford&#x2014;and eventually to the commercial that caught the eye of legendary director Alfred Hitchcock.</p><p>For the first time, Tippi shares the entire story of her complicated relationship with Hitchcock, the man who discovered her talent but also became her obsessive tormentor. Going behind the scenes of her classic films <em>The Birds</em> and <em>Marnie,</em> Tippi details both the glamourous whirlwind that brought her to Hollywood as well as the dark pain she endured while working with Hitchcock, whose controlling behavior and attention quickly proved inescapable. Speaking candidly about being a single mother and shielding her daughter from her struggles on and off of Hitchcock&#x2019;s set, Tippi provides deep insight into some of the most challenging years of her life and demonstrates how, despite Hitchcock&#x2019;s threats to ruin her career, her uncompromising spirit finally gave her the courage to break free. </p><p>Difficult as her experiences with Hitchcock were, they nearly paled in comparison to her time on the set of <em>Roar</em>&#x2014;a film starring dozens of live lions and tigers that has since become one of the most notorious film productions of all time. Including never-before-revealed details about the unbelievable making of the movie, Tippi describes how what began as a simple movie about big cats evolved into a sprawling, dangerous endeavor that consumed her career and often put lives, including hers and her family&#x2019;s, at risk. Tippi offers a clear-eyed and surprising look at the perilous chances they took, while also recounting how these events led to years of animal-rights activism, culminating in the creation of her very own big-cats preserve, Shambala. And yet, through it all, Tippi shows how her career and life have continued to embody her unwavering devotion&#x2014;to her daughter, Melanie; to her animal-rights activism; to her humanitarian relief work overseas; and to her art.</p><p>Filled with sixteen pages of beautiful photographs, <em>Tippi </em>is a rare look at a private woman&#x2019;s truly remarkable life. What emerges is a fascinating portrait of one of Hollywood&#x2019;s greatest treasures&#x2014;an actress whose skill onscreen was matched only by her strength off it.</p><p>Tippi Hedren is an actress and an activist for animal rights, as well as a recognized humanitarian for her efforts with and dedication to the women of Vietnam, helping to create a multibillion-dollar manicuring industry. She has appeared in over thirty-five television projects and more than forty-five films, including the starring roles in Alfred Hitchcock&#x2019;s <em>The Birds</em> and <em>Marnie, </em>and <em>Roar</em>. She also appeared in Charlie Chaplin&#x2019;s last film, <em>A Countess from Hong Kong</em>, making her the only actress to have worked with both great directors. She is the founder of the Shambala Preserve, a wild-animal sanctuary. She lives in Acton, California.</p></p><h2>Animalia</h2><p>Brief tales of wise and holy people who have lived gently with animals, from various countries and cultures, including tales of St. Francis, Buddha, and Siddhartha, and European and Oriental legends.</p><p>PW called this collection of 13 short tales drawn from folklore and religion "an inducement to contemplate the wonders of nature."

Its impact is still fresh, its lessons timeless. When a plague of unprecedented virulence sweeps the globe, the human race is all but wiped out. In the aftermath, as the great machine of civilization slowly, inexorably, breaks down, only a few shattered survivors remain to struggle against the slide into barbarism . . . or extinction. This is the story of one such survivor, Isherwood &#x201c;Ish&#x201d; Williams, an intellectual loner who embraces the grim duty of bearing witness to what may be humanity&#x2019;s final days. But then he finds Em, a wise and courageous woman who coaxes his stunned heart back to life and teaches him to hope again.

Through his work, he observed the great twentieth-century confrontation between bourgeois fin de si�cle culture and myriad new movements and ideologies, from communism and extreme nationalism to Dadaism to the emergence of information technology. In <i>Fractured Times</i>, Hobsbawm, with characteristic verve, unpacks a century of cultural fragmentation.<br><br>Hobsbawm examines the conditions that both created the flowering of the belle �poque and held the seeds of its disintegration: paternalistic capitalism, globalization, and the arrival of a mass consumer society. Passionate but never sentimental, he ranges freely across subjects as diverse as classical music, the fine arts, rock music, and sculpture. He records the passing of the golden age of the free intellectual&#x201d; and explores the lives of forgotten greats; analyzes the relationship between art and totalitarianism; and dissects phenomena as diverse as surrealism, art nouveau, the emancipation of women, and the myth of the American cowboy.<br><br>Written with consummate imagination and skill, <i>Fractured Times</i> is the last book from one of our greatest modern-day thinkers.<br><br></p><p><b>Eric Hobsbawm</b> was born in Alexandria in 1917 and educated in Austria, Germany, and England. He taught at Birkbeck College, University of London, and then at the New School for Social Research in New York. In addition to <i>The Age of Revolution</i>, <i>The Age of Capital</i>, <i>The Age of Empire</i>, and <i>The Age of Extremes</i>, his books include <i>Bandits</i>; <i>Revolutionaries</i>; <i>Uncommon People</i>; and his memoir, <i>Interesting Times</i>. Eric Hobsbawm died in 2012.<b>Praise for <i>Fractured Times</i></b>:<br><br>"Hobsbawm speaks to the crucial need for engaged public intellectuals and the kind of rigorous social and political analysis so well represented by these urgent and important essays."<br> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"<i>Fractured Times</i> shows this revolutionary traditionalist at his best. It is an account of the collapse of the high bourgeois culture of the nineteenth century, and an examination of the ruins it left behind in the twentieth century."<br> <i>The Guardian</i><br><br>"Eric Hobsbawm&#x2019;s <i>Fractured Times</i> is a fascinating engagement with the culture of modernity by its most brilliant and insightful historian. Whether he is writing about Jewish emancipation, the avant garde, the Western, Karl Kraus or forties jazz, these penetrating reflections of a participant observer are guaranteed to take you deeper into the perplexities of the modern than anything you have read before."<br> Robin Blackburn, Distinguished Visiting Professor of History, The New School<br><br>"In this wonderful collection of essays, Hobsbawm gives a theoretically informed and historically sensitive reflection on the cultural manifestations of advanced capitalism. Whether commenting on the gradual demise of classical music or the rise of the phenomenon of celebrity, the range of his knowledge is remarkable, only surpassed by his ability to integrate diverse insights into a coherent vision. This book not only confirms Hobsbawm as a great historian and political thinker but is also a compelling contribution to critical theory."<br> Patrick Baert, Professor of Social Theory, University of Cambridge<br><br>"Only Eric Hobsbawm could have written these engaging and moving evocations of the European world to which he was born and which is now only a memory. When he writes of culture, he writes of himself: at odds with the world, filled with its possibilities, both injured by it and alert to its paradoxes. These essays are the fruits of a master, the likes of which we will not see again."<br> Jay Winter, Charles J. Stille Professor of History, Yale University<br><br>"Punctuated by the four volumes <i>The Age of Revolution</i>, <i>The Age of Capital</i>, <i>The Age of Empire</i> and <i>The Age of Extremes</i>, the works of Eric Hobsbawm served for many of us as indispensable guides to the history of our own time. With his death in 2012, the modern world lost one of its greatest and most controversial historians. This volume of his last essays is a testament to his broad ranging mind, his political engagement, and his tremendous erudition."<br> Peter E. Gordon, Amabel B. James Professor of Modern European History, Harvard University<br><br>"It is a treasure to have the last essays from that great historian Eric Hobsbawm. It&#x2019;s sad to think that there will be no more but here he is in all his strength, his extraordinary range, his ability to write with great perception on a variety of subjects, most frequently here dealing with aspects of art and culture in Europe and elsewhere. Writing with insight about art, he is also keenly aware of its limitations and failures in contributing to making a better world. He is particularly enlightening on those on the left such as J.D. Bernal and Joseph Needham. He concludes with a bravura essay on the American cowboy and the promise that America represented in the past. In a sense in this final essay he circles back to his own childhood, and his love of Karl May, the German writer of cowboy stories. Reading these wonderful pieces reminded me how lucky I was to be one of his students."<br> Peter Stansky, Frances and Charles Field Professor of History, emeritus, Stanford University<br><br><b>Praise for Eric Hobsbawm</b>:<br>"One of the few genuinely great historians of our century."<br> <i>The New Republic</i><br><br>"Eric Hobsbawm surveys the writings of modern historians with the magisterial gaze of a man who has seen both the rise of Hitler and the fall of Communism."<br> <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"One of the greatest British historians of his age. . . .

While numerous historians have investigated the battle, what happened on those plains hundreds of miles from even a whisper of civilization has been obscured by intrigue and deception starting with the very first shots fired. </p><p>Custer's death and the defeat of the 7th Calvary by the Sioux was a shock to a nation that had come to believe that its westward expansion was a matter of destiny. While the first reports defended Custer, many have come to judge him by this single event, leveling claims of racism, disobedience, and incompetence. These false claims unjustly color Custer's otherwise extraordinarily life and fall far short of encompassing his service to his country.</p><p>By reexamining the facts and putting Custer within the context of his time and his career as a soldier, Hatch's <i>The Last Days of George Armstrong Custer </i>reveals the untold and controversial truth of what really happened in the valley of the Little Bighorn, making it the definitive history of Custer's last stand. This history of charging cavalry, desperate defenses, and malicious intrigue finally sets the record straight for one of history's most dynamic and misunderstood figures.</p></p><p><p>THOM HATCH is the author of nine previous books, including <i>Glorious War: The Civil War Adventures of George Armstrong Custer </i>and <i>The Custer Companion: A Comprehensive Guide to the Life of George Armstrong Custer and the Plains Indians Wars</i>.

But the way the shadows hung like drapery around the desk; the way the crook-necked lamp cast its measured oval of light on the polished rosewood; the way the silence lay on the room, unbroken by the hiss of a gas mantle; the way the faint, faint smell of petroleum and electricity, like the odor of wealth itself, rose up from everywhere&#x2014;these things gave the darkness meaning. Nothing in that room was incidental.</p><p>The customer sat behind his desk, in a chair so tall and wide it could have hidden two bodyguards. He leaned away from the light, and it from him. Maybe he&#x2019;d read somewhere that hiding one&#x2019;s face made for psychological advantage in business transactions. He was welcome to think so. He already had the only real advantage: money. All the rest was costume and props.</p><p>The merchandise was contained in a flat metal box half again as long as a hand, which had once been white. I put it on the edge of the desk, just outside the pool of light. Then I laid one finger on it and pushed, so that it skidded across the shining wood and stopped in front of him.</p><p>His hands came up from under the desk and settled on either side of the box. Then the left one rose again, touched the metal, spread flat on it.</p><p>"The one I asked for?" he said. They were the first words out of his mouth since his door had opened and let me in.</p><p>"Look at it."</p><p>He scrabbled a little at the catch, his self-control momentarily breached. One hinge stuck, complaining; then the box opened with a tic, and a broken speck of metal skittered over the rosewood. Inside was another box, plastic. It was mostly deep blue, with a color photo reproduced on it, and the title. He was familiar with the design, I knew. I&#x2019;d brought him others like it, but with different photos, different titles. He opened the second box to reveal the videocassette. He touched the label as if it might be fragile. "Singin&#x2019; in the Rain," he said, and I could hear his satisfaction&#x2014;self-satisfaction, really. He closed the inside box, and the outside. His hands returned to their guard positions, flat on the desk with the tape between them, like brackets in an equation.</p><p>"Do the contents match the label?" His voice was strong now, the voice that ordered that room and everything outside it.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"And is it really the original, or did you make a copy to sell me?"</p><p>At that, I reached out, laid the same single finger on the metal box, and slid it back across the desk to me. His hands curved like little cats rising and stretching. But they didn&#x2019;t reach after the box. He knew the Deal.</p><p>"You can look for it somewhere else," I said politely, "if you aren&#x2019;t comfortable buying from me."</p><p>His mouth, perhaps, had gone dry. I liked to think so.</p><p>We stayed like that for a moment. He might have been considering sending me away, but I doubted it. I had been searching for this one, at his request, for six months.</p><p>Finally he pulled a narrow leather bag into the light and spread it open. He shook the contents into his hand and lined them up, and made sure I saw that the bag was now empty. That was insulting, but not as insulting as his questions. Ten bright, round bits of gold he laid out between us, each with a nice portrait in the center, lovely examples of the coin-making art. Two hundred dollars hard, precisely what he had promised. Such a memory on that man.</p><p>I turned the line of coins into a stack with one hand and passed the box across the desk with the other. I looked at the top coin, then smiled across the barrier of light toward his face. "Remarkable likeness," I said. I made the money disappear, and hoped he&#x2019;d noticed; it was a response to his showing me there was nothing left in the leather bag to steal.</p><p>"Another commission," he said, as if I had asked for one and he was weighing the prospect. He needed this little dance to keep from himself the knowledge that he needed me. "This&#x2019;ll be a hard one."</p><p>"The last one wasn&#x2019;t exactly lying around like gravel."</p><p>He picked up the box that held Singin&#x2019; in the Rain, and turned it over and over in his hands. At last, he said, "I want the Horsemen movie."</p><p>I laughed, which I hadn&#x2019;t meant to do. "No."</p><p>"Why not?"</p><p>"Because I&#x2019;ve never seen it, that&#x2019;s why not. If anyone in the City would have seen it, I would, and I haven&#x2019;t."</p><p>"So you think it doesn&#x2019;t exist." There was chilly disbelief in his voice.</p><p>"I know the folklore. That some poor bastard made a sci-fi-B-movie in which psychic Special Forces soldiers took over the minds of evil brown dictators and won the war in South America. And that some folks who wore dark glasses in the nighttime arrived at his house, asked him urgent questions, and took him into custody. I&#x2019;ve never heard if they let him out. I&#x2019;ve never heard that the thing got video release. I&#x2019;ve never even heard it proved that it was released, period. File the whole story next to Hitchhikers, Comma, Vanishing."</p><p>There was a silence, in which I decided he was trying to figure out what that meant. If he asked, I was going to tell him to look it up.</p><p>"You sound as if you don&#x2019;t believe in the Horsemen."</p><p>Sometimes I feel a profound, crippling sense of loss for something I never had: the world, as it once was. I felt it then. "Of course I believe in the Horsemen. I just don&#x2019;t believe that someone had the bad luck to make a movie about them."</p><p>"You&#x2019;re turning down the job?"</p><p>I shook my head. "I&#x2019;ll look. I&#x2019;ve been looking for years. But I&#x2019;m not going to find it. Not now. If it had ever existed, do you really think there&#x2019;d be a copy left unburnt?"</p><p>"Five hundred," he said.</p><p>I raised my eyebrows. "A thousand, hard. Be glad I don&#x2019;t ask for the hand of your firstborn and half your kingdom."</p><p>"No one&#x2019;d give you a thousand for a goddamn movie."</p><p>"Then if I find it, no one will get it."</p><p>Long, expensive-sounding silence. "If you find it," he said finally, rustily, "bring it to me."</p><p>I smiled, and stifled the impulse to bow. We had not agreed on a price; but we&#x2019;d agreed that his figure and mine marked the borders of a country we were willing to skirmish in later, if the need arose.</p><p>He opened one of his desk drawers, dropped Singin&#x2019; in the Rain into it, closed and locked it. As sometimes happens when a great deal of money changes owners in an atmosphere of bare tolerance, he suddenly turned hearty. He gestured toward a lower corner of the room and said, "Down there, some people call two hundred in gold a fortune, son. What do you plan to do with it all?"</p><p>I smiled; if he couldn&#x2019;t see it, he would still hear it in my voice. "Oh," I said, "I thought I&#x2019;d treat myself to breakfast."</p><p>And that should have been the end of it; but it may be that I don&#x2019;t think clearly with a fortune in my inside pocket. "Have you seen it?" I asked him.</p><p>He was startled enough to get in the way of the light. It made him squint, his eyes lost in pasty white flesh. "Pardon?"</p><p>"Singin&#x2019; in the Rain. Have you seen it?" Dancing over sofas, hanging from lampposts, piling furniture on the speech tutor. Did he have a secret passion for foolery?</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Then how do you know you want it?"</p><p>His answer was all in his face, scornful and baffled at once. Money makes me ask stupid questions. He wanted it, of course, because someone else didn&#x2019;t have it.</p><p>"Debbie Reynolds dies in the end," I told him.</p><p>Five minutes later I was in an elevator rumbling down from the top of the tallest building in the City, with more money than I&#x2019;d ever carried in my life, literally surrounded by wealth and power. And I was mostly sick and frightened with it. When I got outside, onto the street, to anyplace that had ever been touched by sunlight, I would be all right.</p><p>I went past the guard desk, nodded at the man who sat behind it, and tried, as I went out the door, not to look as if I was rushing. I turned right, into the cheerful morning pandemonium of the mall market, and the tight prickling between my shoulders went away.</p><p>I&#x2019;d done a good job, I decided on reflection. That building, that office, that customer, always made me feel claustrophobic and small, but I&#x2019;d kept my mind on the Deal, and it had gone as I&#x2019;d meant it to. I might have sounded a little like Humphrey Bogart in The Maltese Falcon, but there were worse roles.</p><p>I bought eggs and peppers and a few ounces of crumbly cheese at three different stalls, and took them all to a grill cart and had the proprietor turn them into an omelette.</p><p>After breakfast I would hail a bicycle cab and pay for the long, long ride to the western outskirts of the City, where a culture-vulture knew of a sealed-up basement holding the remains of a video production business. It would be, by my standards, a perfect day.</p><p>But it had chaos hidden in it. Cancers start that way: a cell or two, mutated, dividing, a secret for weeks or months until suddenly the transformation announces itself, and the whole organism quails in the face of it. The cells mutated that day, though I knew nothing about it for weeks.</p><p></p><p>Excerpted from Bone Dance by Emma Bull.</p><p>Copyright � 1991 by Emma Bull.</p><p>Published in July 2009 by Tom Doherty Associates.</p><p>All rights reserved.

Stephen attended public school, rode a bike, and read books pressed right up against his nose. As an adult, he coped with his limited vision by becoming a professor in a small college town, memorizing routes for all of the places he needed to be. Then, at the age of 38, he was laid off. With no other job opportunities in his vicinity, he would have to travel to find work. <br> <br> This is how he found himself at Guiding Eyes paired with a Labrador named Corky. In this vivid and lyrical memoir, Stephen Kuusisto recounts how an incredible partnership with a guide dog changed his life and the heart-stopping, wondrous adventure that began for him in midlife. Profound and deeply moving, this is a spiritual journey, the story of discovering that life with a guide dog is both a method and a state of mind.</p><p>Stephen Kuusisto is the author of the memoirs <i>Have Dog, Will Travel; Planet of the Blind </i>(a <i>New York Times</i> &#x201c;Notable Book of the Year&#x201d;); and <i>Eavesdropping: A Memoir of Blindness and Listening</i> and of the poetry collections <i>Only Bread, Only Light </i>and <i>Letters to Borges</i>. A graduate of the Iowa Writer&#x2019;s Workshop and a Fulbright Scholar, he has taught at the University of Iowa, Hobart and William Smith Colleges, and Ohio State University. He currently teaches at Syracuse University where he holds a professorship in the Center on Human Policy, Law, and Disability Studies. He is a frequent speaker in the US and abroad. His website is StephenKuusisto.com.Have Dog, Will Travel Prologue<p></p> <br>People ask: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s it like?&#x201d; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s it like walking with a guide dog?&#x201d; &#x201c;How does a dog keep you from harm?&#x201d; Or they say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I could do that, I mean, what&#x2019;s it really like to trust a dog that way?&#x201d;<br> <br>Truthfully it&#x2019;s not like anything else. There&#x2019;s no true equivalent for the experience.<br> <br>My wife is an equestrian. Years ago she was a guide-dog trainer. &#x201c;On a horse,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re hypervigilant, aiming to avoid accidents by controlling your animal. Sometimes you and your horse will find a meditative rhythm. But you can&#x2019;t count on horses to look out for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>A guide dog is not like a horse. She looks out for you. All the time.<br> <br>What&#x2019;s it like? I can only help you imagine what a guide dog feels like.<br> <br>Say you&#x2019;re in Italy in a swirl of motorbikes. It&#x2019;s Milan with thin sidewalks, confusing street crossings, and barbaric drivers. Montenapoleone Street is crowded with what seems like all the people in the world.<br> <br>Let&#x2019;s say you&#x2019;re walking at night to the Duomo with Guiding Eyes &#x201c;Corky&#x201d; #3cc92. Corky does her thing and relishes her job. She pulls you along but the pull is steady and you feel like you&#x2019;re floating. Her mind and body transmit through a harness an omnidirectional confidence.<br> <br>Why are you going to Milan&#x2019;s famous cathedral with a dog? One of your favorite books is Mark Twain&#x2019;s The Innocents Abroad, which contains passages so beautiful you sometimes recite them aloud. Of the Duomo Twain says it has &#x201c;a delusion of frostwork that might vanish with a breath!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The central one of its five great doors is bordered with a bas-relief of birds and fruits and beasts and insects, which have been so ingeniously carved out of the marble that they seem like living creatures&#x2014;and the figures are so numerous and the design so complex, that one might study it a week without exhausting its interest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now it&#x2019;s just you and your dog. You&#x2019;re going there to touch the birds and fruits and beasts and insects carved from marble.<br> <br>Not only are the streets teeming with people, there are skateboarders. Now your Labrador eases left. You hear a clatter of wheels. You think how Milan must be dangerous for skateboarding with its jagged paving bricks, broken sidewalks, and Vespas like runaway donkeys. Motorbikes plunge through crowds. Someone does a dance with death every twenty feet. The city is a fantastic, ghastly place. In the midst of this your dog is unflappable. Trained to estimate your combined width, she looks for advantages in the throng and pulls ahead because the way is clear or she slows suddenly because an elderly woman has drifted sideways into your path. Sometimes she stops on a dime, refusing to move. Which she does now.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a hole in the pavement. It&#x2019;s unmarked&#x2014;there are no pylons or signs. A stranger says it&#x2019;s remarkable there aren&#x2019;t a dozen people at the bottom of the thing. Corky has saved you from breaking your neck. She backs away, turns, then pushes ahead.<br> <br>It doesn&#x2019;t feel like driving a car. It&#x2019;s not like running. Sometimes I think it&#x2019;s a bit like swimming. A really long swim when you&#x2019;re buoyant and fast. There&#x2019;s no one else in the pool.<br> <br>Yes, this is sort of what it&#x2019;s like, but there&#x2019;s something else&#x2014;a keen affection between you and your dog, a mutual discernment. Together you&#x2019;ve got the other&#x2019;s back.</p><h2>The Walton Experience</h2><p>The incredible account of one man&#39;s abduction by a UFO -- Travis Walton reveals what happened during the five harrowing days of his disappearance!

It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted &#x2014;for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame.

Where he is, there is nature. He measures you and all men and all events. Ordinarily, every body in society reminds us of somewhat else, or of some other person.

The wilderness of Little Traverse Bay had just been opened for homesteading, and the Hedricks joined a dozen other white families in the trading post of Little Traverse, situated in virgin forest. From the age of four until he left the area at eighteen, U. P. Hedrick saw the shabby trading post rum into the tidy village of Harbor Springs. In those years, mechanized logging replaced the homesteader's crosscut saw;<br>the passenger pigeon disappeared; and the railroad arrived. </p><p>Hedrick writes of his youth and shows himself to be a sharp and often witty observer of the little details of domestic life on the Michigan frontier. He expounds on cooking whitefish and blackberry rolypoly, on the farmer's "arsenal of axes," on pigs and their parts-both edible and useful, on wild and cultivated fruits, on trees, on kettles, and on Indians of the area. Lovers of Michigan's woods and fields, lakes and rivers; professional historians; and storytellers will find themselves delighted<br>by Hedrick's account.

His name is invoked for a staggering range of causes; statists and libertarians, nationalists and States' righters, conservatives and radicals all claim his blessing. In this book, Forrest McDonald examines Jefferson's performance as the nation's leader, evaluating his ability as a policy-maker, administrator, and diplomat.<br><br>He delineates, carefully and sympathetically, the Jeffersonian ideology and the agrarian ideal that underlay it; he traces the steps by which the ideology was transformed into a program of action; and he concludes that the interplay between the ideology and the action accounted both for the unparalleled success of Jefferson's first term in office, and for the unmitigated failure of the second term.<br><br>Jefferson as president was a man whose ideological commitments prevented him from reversing calamitous policy stances, a man who could be ruthless in suppressing civil rights when it was politically expedient, a man who was rarely, in the conventional sense of the word, a Jeffersonian. McDonald's portrait reveals him to be at once greater, simpler, and more complexly human than the mere "apostle of liberty" or "spokesman for democracy" that his adulators have relegated him to being.</p><p>"An elegant and revelatory analysis."--Gore Vidal, author of <i>Burr</i> and <i>1876</i> <p>"A brilliant and important book, one that can be studied with profit and read and remembered with delight."--George Dangerfield, author of <i>The Awakening of American Nationalism, 1815-1828</i></p>Forrest McDonald is Distinguished Research Professor of History at the University of Alabama and the author of fifteen books including <i>States' Rights and the Union: Imperium in Imperio, 1776-1876; The American Presidency: An Intellectual History; Novus Ordo Seclorum: The Intellectual Origins of the Constitution; "We the People": Economic Origins of the Constitution; E Pluribus Unum: The Foundation of the American Republic, 1776-1790</i>; and <i>The Presidency of George Washington</i>.

The stunning work combines illuminating essays by distinguished Jewish historians with 110 rare photographs to trace the community from its tentative beginnings in colonial Boston through its emergence in the twentieth century as one of the most influential and successful Jewish communities in America. The volume also presents fascinating information about Boston&#39;s synagogues and Jewish neighborhoods as well as the evolution of Jewish culture in Boston and the United States.</p><p><b>Jonathan D. Sarna</b> is the Joseph H. and Belle R. Braun Professor of American Jewish History at Brandeis University. Ellen Smith is curator at the American Jewish Historical Society. Thomas H. O&#x2019;Connor is University Historian and Professor of History, Emeritus, at Boston College. He is the author of numerous books on Boston history, including B<i>oston Catholics: A History of the Church and Its People</i> and<i> The Hub: Boston Past and Present</i>.<br>This book of essays and photographs, released in hardcover in 1995 to critical acclaim, is now available in an updated, revised paperback edition at less than half the hardcover asking price. The content is outstanding. The essays (by Brandeis University's Sarna, museum curator Smith, and a host of other scholars) are at once weighty and accessible to general readers who are interested in the history of Boston's Jews. From the first recorded Jew in the city (Solomon Franco, in 1649) to the 21st century, this volume organizes the Jewish experience into chronological and thematic order, with various essays addressing assimilation, synagogues, philanthropy, Zionism, education and culture. More than 100 illustrations and photographs bring history to life: we see images of community centers and synagogues, yes, but we also see Jewish life in action: customers waiting outside a kosher butchery in Brookline; a multiracial klezmer musical troupe at the New England conservatory; a ladies' auxiliary of Beth Israel hospital in 1915. The book contains some new material not in the 1995 edition, including an essay by a Boston College historian on Jewish-Christian relations, and a piece by Sarna and Kosofsky on developments since 1995. More than just a community history, this excellent book uses Boston's experience as a window into understanding American Judaism more generally.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The result of a rare sabbatical from this famed chef's 4-star kitchen, <i>A Return to Cooking</i> is "an unprecedented look at the creative process of one of the world&#x2019;s best chefs" (Anthony Bourdain) as Eric Ripert prepares simple meals for friends in different locations, using ingredients at hand.<br><br>Expect to be enchanted by Eric's lack of pretense and his irrepressible joie&#x2014;a chef who likes American mayonnaise and alphabet pasta, but can also lecture on subjects as diverse as the power of vinaigrette and the merits of Tabasco, shallots, and coconut milk. And every bit as fascinating is the bird's-eye view of the magic that occurs when decades of cooking experience coalesce with the forces of a chef's intuition.<br></p><p>Eric Ripert, chef and part owner of New York's Le Bernadin, discovered that as his chef star rose he drifted far, far away from cooking. <i>A Return to Cooking</i> is his response to this sorry predicament, the result of a self-imposed challenge: to gather together disparate souls--a painter (Valentino Cortazar), a writer (Michael Ruhlman, author of <i>The Making of a Chef</i> and <i>The Soul of a Chef</i>), photographers (Shimon and Tammar Rothstein), and a personal assistant (Andrea Glick, who would write and test the spontaneously created recipes)--and simply cook.<p>The settings (and fresh food ingredients) are spectacular. Sag Harbor in summer. Puerto Rico in winter. California's Napa Valley in spring. Vermont in fall. Rent a house, shop for food, and make the meals happen. For anyone who has ever wanted to understand how a great cook looks at ingredients and settles on a plan, <i>A Return to Cooking</i> is it. In Puerto Rico the reader is treated to Caramelized Pineapple Crepes with Cr�me Fr�iche; Shrimp with Fresh Coconut Milk, Calabaza, and Avocado; and Seared Tuna with Escabeche of Pear Tomatoes.</p><p>What Ripert does with food, the Rothsteins do with photos, Cortazar does with paints, and Ruhlman does with words. The stimulating recipes rise out of a young lifetime of experience. This is a big, lush book (330 pages, 150 recipes, nearly 400 color photos and illustrations) dense with information, technique, and flavor. For anyone who has wandered far from the kitchen and the pleasures inherent in cooking, <i>A Return to Cooking</i> will bring you right back home. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>Michael Ruhlman is the author of <i>The Elements of Cooking, The Soul of a Chef</i>, and <i>The Making of a Chef: Mastering Heat at the Culinary Institute of America</i>, among others.</p><h2>The Leonardo Dicaprio Album</h2><p>Traces the life and career of the young actor who received an Oscar nomination for his work in &#34;What&#39;s Eating Gilbert Grape?&#34;</p><p>Despite its 53 mouthwatering photos, there's bad news for lustful female fans in this bestselling Leonardo DiCaprio book. "I'm probably not going to get married unless I live with somebody for 10 to 20 years," Leo confesses. "[Boys nowadays] don't have the balls that Romeo did." But the good news, according to Leo's on-camera Juliet, Claire Danes, is that he is still "rather immature." So there may be hope! But beware of a too-direct approach: "Not that I mind being recognized, but all these teenage girls have become hysterical, man. What they do is shocking, climbing over walls and stuff."<p> Biographer Brian Robb covers Leo's career from childhood (when he got booted from <i>Romper Room</i> for being rowdy) to his Oscar nomination for <i>What's Eating Gilbert Grape?</i> and onward. Leo took what would've been River Phoenix's parts in <i>The Basketball Diaries</i> and <i>Total Eclipse</i>. Then he moved teens to tears in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> (check out the <i>Shakespeare Made Easy</i> edition with a modern English translation and Shakespeare's original text side by side) and moved grownups to tears in <i>Marvin's Room</i>, a bestseller in Japan. Then he made the world weep in <i>James Cameron's Titanic</i>.</p><p> What's next? Whatever he likes. "Fame," as Leo observes, "is like a VIP pass wherever you want to go." --Tim Appelo, Bestsellers editor</p></p><h2>How to Talk to an Autistic Kid</h2><p><p>Kids with autism have a hard time communicating, which can be frustrating for autistic kids <i>and</i> for their peers. In this intimate yet practical book, author Daniel Stefanski, a fourteen-year-old boy with autism, helps readers understand why autistic kids act the way they do and offers specific suggestions on how to get along with them.</p><p>While many "typical" kids know someone with autism, they sometimes misunderstand the behavior of autistic kids, which can seem antisocial or even offensive&#x2013;even if the person with autism really wants to be friends. The result of this confusion is often painful for those with autism: bullying, teasing, excluding, or ignoring. <i>How to Talk to an Autistic</i> is an antidote. Written by an autistic kid for non-autistic kids, it provides personal stories, knowledgeable explanations, and supportive advice&#x2013;all in Daniel's unique and charming voice and accompanied by lively illustrations.</p><p>Always straightforward and often humorous, <i>How to Talk to an Autistic Kid</i> will give readers&#x2013;kids and adults alike&#x2013;the confidence and tools needed to befriend autistic kids.&nbsp;They'll also feel like they've made a friend already&#x2013;Daniel.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>An autistic teen gives friendly suggestions on how to better understand, talk with, and be a good friend to autistic kids<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Daniel Stefanski is fourteen years old and autistic. He has a passion for writing and drawing and likes to declare proudly "I'm autistic and artistic." A talented golfer, Daniel has participated in the Special Olympics and other competitive golf events. At age four, he was adopted from an orphanage in Bulgaria and flew 18 hours with his new mom to his new home in Valparaiso, Indiana. An animal lover and shelter volunteer, Daniel is surrounded by the love of his mom, dad, stepfather, brother, and five dogs.</p></p><h2>You&#39;re On Your Way, Teddy Roosevelt</h2><p>Before Teddy Roosevelt became famous as a statesman, naturalist, colonel in the Spanish-American War, and twenty-sixth president of the United States, he was a young boy called Teedie who had wonderful adventures with his brother and sister and even started a museum in his attic. But he also struggled with terrible asthma. Overcoming his illness was the major battle of his young life . . . and his determination to make himself strong and healthy set the course for his amazing accomplishments to come.<br> First in a planned series of picture storybooks about "turning points" in the lives of the young Presidents, this book is written by the in-comparable author of So You Want to Be President? and whimsically illustrated by Matthew Faulkner.</p><p>Judith St. George lives in Connecticut.Gr. 2-4. In <i>You're on Your Way, Teddy Roosevelt</i>, the first in the new Turning Point Book series, St. George marshals the same lively spirit she used in her Caldecott Medal winner <i>So You Want to Be President?</i> (2000) to tell the story of "Teedie" Roosevelt's childhood. Faulkner's cartoon-style illustrations present the history and the characters from the young boy's viewpoint as St. George describes Roosevelt's triumph over debilitating asthma and his success as an athlete and student. St. George never minimizes Roosevelt's struggle; one particularly memorable picture shows the bespectacled, awkward city weakling being harassed by country bullies. The truth about failure will appeal to kids as much as the gentle message about determination and achievement. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

They never really had a Golden Age. From "Big Jim" Colosimo, the patron saint of Chicago's Mafia, to Brooklyn's Sammy "The Bull" Gravano a century later, organized crime has controlled huge swaths of the mainline labor movement. It still does.<p> Impassioned, revelatory, prodigiously researched and reported, and thoroughly convincing, <b>Solidarity for Sale</b> shows how the American labor movement's decent ends are continually undermined by its tawdry means &#x2014; a diet of daily corruption longer than the menu at a Long Island diner. By telling the untold histories, uncovering the covered-up scandals, and even recommending a way forward, Robert Fitch builds a devastating indictment and goes beyond it to show that union corruption, stagnation, and decline are not our national destiny. Labor could regain its needed place in American life. But it would require a set of reforms deeper than anything now being proposed; nothing less than a revolutionary overthrow of its culture of corruption and its replacement by a civic culture of accountability and consent.</p></p><p><b>Robert Fitch</b> joined the Laborer's Union, Local 5 in Chicago Heights, Illinois when he was fifteen years old. He eventually traded his shovel for a briefcase and has since taught at Cornell and New York University, organized for the unions, and written for <i>The Baffler, Newsday, Village Voice, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times</i> and <i>The Nation</i>. Still a union member, he lives in New York City.With this passionate but meandering call for reform, union member and journalist Fitch attempts to expose the systemic corruption&#x2014;the "private use of public office"&#x2014;that he deems central to the history of American labor and its current ineffectuality. After two scattered and polemical introductory chapters that put the corruption of American labor unions in a global context, the book traces a century's worth of labor history, from the 1881 founding of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters to the mob-backed looting of the Mason Tenders pension fund in the 1990s. Fitch likens labor unions to fiefdoms and union leaders to warlords while comparing their level of corruption to that of the pre-Reformation Catholic Church. He implicates historical figures from early 20th-century AFL president Samuel Gompers and mid-century Teamster Jimmy Hoffa to Bill Clinton and Rudolph Giuliani, whom he censures for their coziness with unscrupulous union leaders. This sweeping condemnation, though provocative, suffers from the breadth of material and its diffuse thematic rather than chronological presentation. The book's structural flaws make for reading that often proves as frustrating as it is fascinating. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Given their increasingly unpredictable and elongated lives, men need to reinvent themselves and expand the ways they demonstrate their manliness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hundreds of men have told their stories in their own words to Gail Sheehy, author of the bestselling New Passages and The Silent Passage. Sheehy makes the case that it is men in middle life who have the best chance to become masters of their fates. Featured are confidences from both celebrities and everyday heroes, creating a mirror in which every man can locate his possibilities for growth and change. These bold, feisty, imaginative men recount how they have discovered what is missing and forged new directions to invigorate the second half of their lives. They share a fantastic secret: "Hey, I'm not as old as I used to be!"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding Men's Passages is a concise guide for men (and the women in their lives) as they confront the major issues of each passage:<br><br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you make change work for you?<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;Where can you find new passion and pur-pose?<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;How can you be the father you wish your father was?<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;What can you do to exercise influence as you grow older?<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;How can you deal successfully with "male menopause"?<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;What strategies can defeat depression?<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;How can you survive a job change or downsizing?<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;What keeps a man young?<br> �&nbsp;&nbsp;When men and women face the same passage with different needs and directions, how does marriage survive?<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stories of men who are redirecting their lives offer concrete information as well as inspiration.Gail Sheehy's Understanding Men's Passages will be a man's secret friend--a short, witty, knowing guide to self-renewal. And every woman will find it a must-read.</p><p>Gail Sheehy's taboo-breaking book about women's menopause, <i>The Silent Passage</i>, was named one of the most influential books of our time by the Library of Congress. <i>Understanding Men's Passages</i> is just as powerful and is certain to change the landscape of the psychology of men. Inspired by her husband's struggle with a midlife career crisis, Sheehy has compiled nearly 10 years worth of interviews and research into this book, revealing the fears and self-doubts of men over 40 who struggle with identity crises both at work and with their partners and children. <p> Sheehy also defines male menopause as a period in which hormones, including testosterone--and therefore potency and sex drive--drop, and men suffer from irritability and mood swings. She cites the statistics that claim more than 52 percent of men between the ages of 40 and 70 can expect some degree of impotence--which translates into at least 20 million men. "When ignored or denied, this sexual freeze extends more deeply into every aspect of a man's life than was previously thought," she writes. "It can be an underlying cause of depression, divorce, even suicide." </p><p> The men Sheehy interviewed were surprisingly candid about their situations and are glad that they've opened up a discourse. Says one man about the silence regarding sexual changes his father endured during his passage into male menopause: "The only sign of getting older probably was that earlier trip to the bathroom in the morning--which we call the six a.m. passage." In addition to covering male menopause and the latest treatments for impotence, Sheehy also includes chapters on how to handle empty-nest syndrome, job downsizing, and the strain on marriage that retirement brings about, but her main point rings clear throughout: "We need an expanded definition of manliness."</p>"An optimistic analysis of adult development in pessimistic times. . . . It is grounded in the economic and psychological realities that make adult life so complex today."<p>--The New York Times Book Review <br><br>Passages<br><br>"Provokes the same recognition that we experience in a good novel. . . . Her research is thorough and imaginative . . . irresistibly invites the reader to join in."</p><p>--The New York Times Book Review <br><br>The Silent Passage<br><br>"A compelling discussion about menopause. Laid out eloquently are the facts, the folklore, and the fears."</p><p>--Kirkus Reviews<br></p></p><h2>Rebel Heart: The Scandalous Life of Jane Digby</h2><p>Traces the life of the adventurous nineteenth-century Englishwoman, whose divorce made her a social outcast, despite her legendary beauty and intelligence, and prompted her to travel the world in the company of many fascinating men of the time.</p><p><p>Mary Lovell is the author of the bestselling biographies of Beryl Markham, &#x2018;Straight on Til Morning&#x2019;, and of Amelia Earhart, &#x2018;The Sound of Wings&#x2019;. She is currently engaged on a dual biography of Richard and Isabel Burton.</p>When she was 21, Digby (1807-1881), a beautiful English aristocrat, shocked London society by leaving her husband and young son to pursue an Austrian diplomat with whom she was having a love affair. Digby's subsequent divorce was literally front-page news as the London Times "cleared its traditional front page of classified advertisements to carry [the] sensational news story" in the form of "a verbatim report of the... divorce hearing in Parliament." The divorce then led to self-imposed exile on the continent, where she had many lovers (including Ludwig I of Bavaria), married two more times and bore five children, although she never lived with or formed lasting bonds with her surviving offspring. Drawing on primary research, including Digby's letters and diaries, Lovell (Straight On Till Morning) brings her unconventional subject to life in this outstanding portrait. At the age of 50, Digby embarked on her fourth and happiest marriage, to bandit Chief Sheikh Medjuel of Arabia and, adopting her husband's culture, spent part of each year with the bedouin nomads in the desert. Lovell provides vivid descriptions of tribal life as well as Digby's more lavish existence in Damascus, where she entertained Western tourists. So much for repressed Victorians.

Ensor (1860-1949) was a major figure in the Belgian avant-garde of the late nineteenth century and an important precursor to the development of Expressionism in the early twentieth, yet his work is underappreciated in the United States, and far too little seen. This striking volume, published on the occasion of Ensor&#39;s major 2009 exhibition in New York, gives the artist the attention he so greatly deserves. It presents approximately 90 works, organized thematically, examining Ensor&#39;s Modernity, his innovative and allegorical approach to light, his prominent use of satire, his deep interest in carnival and performance and, finally, his own self-fashioning and use of masking, travesty and role-playing. Works in the full range of his media--painting, printing and drawing--are presented in an overlapping network of themes and images to produce a complete picture of this daring body of art. The most comprehensive volume on the artist available in English, this remarkable, scholarly volume reveals Ensor as a socially engaged and self-critical artist involved with the issues of his times and contemporary debates on the very nature of Modernism.</p><p>James Ensor grew up in the seaside town of Ostend, Belgium, where he returned after studying at the Academie de Bruxelles, and worked for the rest of his life. Ensor painted in a studio that had once been his aunt and uncle's shell and souvenir shop, and although he shut its doors to the public, he left some of the merchandise as it was. As a leading member of the avant-garde group Les Vingt (The Twenty) he shared their harsh critical reception, but after Les Vingt disbanded, he continued to work and eventually won wide acclaim. By the time of his death in 1949 he had been made a baron, and his home is now the Ensor House museum. <p> Anna Swinbourne is Assistant Curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture, The Museum of Modern Art.</p>The MoMA survey... is an artist&#39;s-artist show.

In the tradition of Mae West, Brill has the goods on dates and diets, bras and bathing, clubhopping and trend-setting. Illustrations and photographs throughout.</p><p>A self-described "designer/actress/model/author businesswoman," Brill was as much a creation of 1980s excess as leveraged buy-outs. Piles of blond hair, a 39-inch bosom and a genius for self-promotion gave visibility, if not credence, to her claims to be "Queen of the Night," "a contemporary Sex Goddess" and "the babe who's everywhere." Now, in this how-to book, Brill wannabes can learn how to dress like her, flirt like her, push their breasts into shapes like hers, even self-promote like her. If there were a hint of the author's tongue being in her cheek, this book would be a laugh-out-loud satirical riot. Unfortunately, Brill is dead serious. For her, the only reality is what other people think of you; her shallow advice is a particularly revolting manifestation of the "you look marvelous" philosophy that formed the personal counterpart to Wall Street's "greed is good" business credo. Brill seems to have missed the fact that the 1980s are over and the junk bond market has collapsed--or maybe she's just hoping that no such calamity befalls the junk book market. Caveat emptor.

Cullina notes that ferns, moss, and grasses are the green canvas for colorful blooms: they bring a level of refinement and sophistication that no flower can match, and no garden is complete without them. <i>Native Ferns, Moss and Grasses</i> offers a thorough discussion of plant hardiness, and for each species the natural range, type of soil, and habitat in which the plant thrives is indicated. The book concludes with complete information on where to buy featured plants and suggested species for various uses and spaces.</p></p><p>William Cullina, nursery manager and propagator at the Garden in the Woods, the famous showplace headquarters of the New England Wild Flower Society, has been passionate about plants since he was a child. He has traveled extensively in the United States and Canada, studying and photographing plants. His very wide interests include collecting orchids (one thousand miniature epiphytes), making wheel-thrown stoneware, and building furniture from wood he has cut and turned to lumber himself. He writes for the major gardening magazines and is in great demand as a speaker.Reigning over a trove of native flora at the New England Wild Flower Society, Cullina directs his expertise primarily to conservation, research, and education while bringing artistry to the horticultural realm of the society&#x2019;s Garden in the Woods. In previous books, Cullina dealt with wildflowers, trees, shrubs, and vines. His latest effort looks at the panoply of textures available to the gardener who wishes to incorporate ferns or mosses into a shady, woodland setting or perhaps needs help selecting grasses for a sunny meadow. Cullina stresses the importance of each native plant&#x2019;s genetic makeup as he guides readers to an understanding of hardiness factors from coast to coast, invasive species, and the effects of global warming. For the keen gardener or nursery professional, the book should prove an invaluable and authoritatively selective resource, with listings that provide common names, natural habitats, and cultural requirements as well as Cullina&#x2019;s lively plant descriptions and personal musings. --Alice Joyce</p><h2>Follow-the-Line Quilting Designs: Full-Size Patterns for Blocks and Borders</h2><p><p>Finally, you have exactly what you need to "quilt as desired"!

MY SWEET AUDRINA The house in the wood was picturesque and charming. The family who lived there were happy and affluent. So what was the secret of the room -- empty of everything but the rocking chair? Audrina wanted to be as good as her sister. Audrina knew her parents could not love her as they loved her sister. Her sister was perfect, much loved -- and dead. But how did she die? Who was Audrina and who did she have to become? What was the secret that everyone knew? Everyone except sweet Audrina! The haunting story of love and deceit, innocence and betrayal, and terrible family secrets.</p><p>Virginia Andrews lived in Norfolk, Virginia, studied art and worked as a fashion illustrator, commercial artist and portrait painter. Flowers in the Attic, based on a true story, was her first novel. It became an immediate bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic when it was first published in 1979. Virginia Andrews died in 1986, leaving a considerable amount of unpublished work.<b>Part 1: Whitefern</b><br><br>There was something strange about the house where I grew up. There were shadows in the corners and whispers on the stairs and time was as irrelevant as honesty. Though how I knew that I couldn't say.<br><br>There was a war going on in our house, a silent war that sounded no guns, and the bodies that fell were only wishes that died and the bullets were only words and the blood that spilled was always called pride.<br><br>Though I'd never been to school -- and I was seven years old and it was high time I was in school -- it seemed I knew all about the Civil War. Around me the Civil War was still being waged, and though the future might stretch ahead for billions of years, it was still the war we'd never forget, for our pride had been injured, and our passions were lingering on. We'd lost the battle better won by the opposite side. Maybe that's why it still kept hurting.<br><br>Momma and my aunt Ellsbeth always said that men liked violent discussions about wars better than any other topic, but if there were other wars of any importance at all, they were never discussed in our house. Papa would read any book, see any movie, cut out any magazine photo that represented that war between brothers, even though his ancestors had fought against my maternal ones. He was Yankee born, but a Southerner by preference. At the dinner table he'd recount the plots of the long novels he read about General Robert E. Lee and give grisly accounts of all the bloody battles. And if most of what he read charmed me, it did not charm either my aunt, who preferred the television, or my mother, who preferred to read her own books, claiming Papa left out the best parts, which weren't fit for young ears to hear.<br><br>That meant my ears, and my cousin Vera's ears. Though most of the world believed Vera to be my sister, I knew she was my unmarried aunt's illegitimate daughter -- and that we had to shield her from the scorn of society by pretending she was my legitimate older sister. I did have a legitimate older sister, too, but she had died before I was born. Her name was also Audrina, and even though she had been dead a long time, still she lingered on. My papa never forgot the first and best Audrina, and still hoped that someday I would be as special as she was.<br><br>My cousin Vera liked people to think she was my sister. I didn't know her true age, for she refused to tell me that. Nobody in our house ever revealed their ages. Only my age was talked about all the time. It was Vera's boast that she could be any age she wanted to be -- ten, twelve, fifteen, and even twenty. With a few elegant and sophisticated postures, truly she did change her manner and expression. She could look very mature -- or very childlike -- depending on her mood. She liked to ridicule me because I was so uncertain about time. Often Vera told me I'd hatched full blown from a giant ostrich egg at the age of seven. She always said that I had inherited that bird's famous habit of sticking its head in the sand and pretending nothing in the world was wrong. She didn't know about my dreams and the ugliness they gave me.<br><br>From the very beginning, I knew Vera was my enemy even when she pretended to be my friend. Though I wanted her for my friend in the worst way, I knew she hated me. She was jealous because I was an Audrina and she wasn't. Oh, how I wanted Vera to like and admire me, as sometimes I really liked and admired her. I envied her, too, because she was normal and didn't have to try to be like someone who was dead. No one seemed to care if Vera wasn't special. No one except Vera. Vera was fond of telling me that I wasn't really special, either, I was merely strange. To tell the truth, I thought there was something strange about me, too. I seemed to be unable to recall anything about my early childhood. I couldn't remember anything about the past -- what I had done the week or even the day before. I didn't know how I had learned the things I knew, or why I seemed to know some things I shouldn't.<br><br>The many clocks scattered throughout our giant house confused me even more. The grandfather clocks in the halls chimed out different hours; the cuckoos in their wooden Swiss clocks popped in and out of small ornate doors, each contradicting all the others; the fancy French clock in my parents' bedroom had stopped long ago at midnight or noon, and a Chinese clock ran backwards. To my great distress, though I searched everywhere, there were no calendars in our house, not even old ones. And the newspapers never came on the day they were due. Our only magazines were old ones, stacked in closets, hidden in the attic. Nobody threw anything away in our house. It was kept, saved for our descendents, so they could sell it one day and make a fortune.<br><br>Much of my insecurity had to do with the first Audrina, who had died exactly nine years before I was born. She had died mysteriously in the woods after cruel and heartless boys had spoiled her in some indescribable way, and because of her, I was never supposed to enter the woods, even to go to school. And the woods were all around us, almost smothering us. They embraced us on three sides, the River Lyle on the fourth. To go anywhere we had to travel through the woods.<br><br>Everywhere in our home photographs of the First and Best Audrina were scattered. On Papa's desk, there were three framed portraits of her, at age one, two and three. There was not one single baby picture of me, not one, and that hurt. The First Audrina had been a beautiful little girl, and when I looked at her photographs, I felt oddly haunted, wanting to be her so badly I ached inside. I wanted to be her so I'd feel as loved, as special as everyone said she had been; and then again, contrarily, I wanted more than anything to be myself, and on my own merits gain the love I felt denied me.<br><br>Oh, the tales Papa could tell me about the wonders of his first daughter, and everyone he told made me know I was not the Best Audrina, not the perfect and special one -- only the second and the inferior one.<br><br>My parents kept the first Audrina's bedroom like a shrine for a dead princess. It was left exactly as it had been on the day she met her fate, which was never explained in detail to me. That room was so full of toys it seemed more a playroom than a bedroom. Momma herself cleaned that room, and she hated housework. Just to see <i>her</i> room made me realize nothing had been too good for <i>her,</i> while my bedroom lacked toy shelves, and her vast array of playthings. I felt cheated, cheated of a real childhood. Audrina the First and Best had stolen my youth, and everyone talked so much about her that I couldn't remember anything about me. I believed it was because of her that my memory was so full of holes.<br><br>Papa would try to fill those holes by putting me in her rocking chair and making me rock and sing until I became "the empty pitcher that would fill with everything."<br><br>He wanted me to fill with her memories and capture her special powers since she was dead and didn't need them anymore.<br><br>And as if one ghost weren't enough, we had a second who came every Tuesday at four. "Teatime," we called Aunt Mercy Marie's day. There she'd sit on the piano, in her black and white photograph in a silver frame, her fat face beaming a vacuous smile, her pale blue eyes staring out as if she could see us, when she couldn't. She was dead, and yet undead, just like my dead sister.<br><br>My aunt and my mother would speak for Aunt Mercy Marie, and through her they would let loose all the venom they held back and saved for "teatimes." Strangely enough, my cousin Vera enjoyed these Tuesday teatimes so much she'd find any reason to play hookey from school, just to be there and hear all the ugly things my mother and her half sister could say to one another. They were Whitefern sisters, and once upon a far ago time, that had meant something wonderful. Now it meant something sad, but they would never tell me exactly what.<br><br>Long ago the Whitefern family had been the most notable family in our Tidewater section of Virginia, giving the country senators and vice presidents. But we'd fallen out of favor not just with the villagers, but also with everyone, and we were no longer honored, or even respected.<br><br>Our house was far from the nearest city of any size.<br><br>Whitefern Village was fifteen miles down a lonely country road, but we seldom went there. It was as if long ago some secret war had been declared, and we in our castle (as Papa liked to call our home) were hated by the "serfs" in the lowlands. If anyplace in our vicinity could be called "highlands" it was the slight hill on which Whitefern sat.<br><br>Papa had to drive thirty miles to and from his stockbrokerage office. All the friends we had lived in the city. Our nearest neighbors were twelve miles away as a car drove, five as a crow flew. Papa drove our only car to work, leaving all of us without transportation. So often my aunt Ellsbeth would bemoan the day she'd sold her small car to buy the TV set.<br><br>My aunt, who'd never been married, loved her portable television set with a twelve-inch screen. She seldom allowed me to watch, though her daughter, Vera, could watch as much as she liked when she was home from school. That was another thing I couldn't understand: why Vera was allowed to go to school when I couldn't go. School was dangerous for me, but not for Vera.<br><br>Naturally I presumed there had to be something terribly wrong with me. My parents had to hide me away to keep me safe, if not from outsiders, then from myself. That was the scariest thought of all.<br><br>At the age of seven, while other children boarded yellow buses and rode off giggling and having fun, I sat down at the kitchen table and was taught how to read, write, add and subtract by my mother, who played the piano beautifully but was not good at teaching anything but how to play the piano. Fortunately, or maybe not, my aunt Ellsbeth was there to help. She had once been a gradeschool teacher with ready slaps to deliver any boy who dared to call her a nasty name. Just one slap too many, and the parents had seen that my aunt was fired. Though she tried for many a year to find another teaching position, the word was out. My aunt had a ferocious temper and a ready hand.<br><br>Aunt Ellsbeth, like her daughter, Vera, also had ready comments to criticize our way of living. According to my aunt we were all as "antediluvian" as the house in which we lived. "Out of sync with the rest of the world," she'd say.<br><br>In my dreams of home, Whitefern loomed up high and white against a dark and stormy sky, frightening to behold. It threatened in the night, but in the day it welcomed me with open arms. I had a habit of sitting outside on the lawn and admiring the grandness of Whitefern. It was a gingerbread Victorian house of many frills, with its white paint peeling, its dark blinds loose and crooked. It had three stories, with an attic and a basement toward the back half of the house where the spacious lawn inclined toward the River Lyle. As I stared at that house, I thought I had much in common with it. We were both antediluvian and out of sync.<br><br>Our windows were myriad, many of them beautiful stained glass. The shutters, about to fall off, were so darkly red they appeared black from a distance, like dried blood. From the outside the most marvelous thing of all were the balustrades on all the many porches, balconies and verandas, designed to look like stylized woodferns.<br><br>In the very center of the dark roof was a round cupola with a copper roof now turned green from tarnish. It formed a point that was topped by a golden ball whose gold leaf was coming off bit by bit each time it rained.<br><br>The cupola was about fourteen feet in diameter, and every single one of its many windows was made of leaded stained glass with scenes to represent the angels of life and death.<br><br>Inside and out, ferns cascaded everywhere from wicker stands. There were other plants, but the ferns seemed to steal what moisture there was in the air so soon all other plants died.<br><br>On stealthy, timid feet I played my small lonely games in the great foyer where the stained glass from the double front doors threw colorful patterns on the floor. Rapier-sharp colors sometimes, stabbing into my brain and punching holes there. I also had little rhymes Vera had taught me that I said to protect myself from the colors:<br><br><i>Step on black, live forever in a shack.<br><br>Step on green, never be clean.<br><br>Step on blue, work will never be through.<br><br>Step on yellow, hear the world bellow.<br><br>Step on red, soon be dead.</i><br><br>Just so I wouldn't have to step on any color, I stole along near the walls, keeping to the shadows, listening to the clocks ticking away the wrong times and the silly cuckoos going crazy in the night. When the wind blew hard, the shutters banged and the floors creaked, the furnace in the basement coughed, sputtered, groaned, and the wind chimes in the cupola tinkled, tinkled.<br><br>Yet in the daytime there were things so wondrously grand in our house that I felt like Alice lost in a house of jewels. Art deco lamps and <i>objets d'art</i> were scattered hither and yon. Tiffany lamps rose up to throw more colors, to pattern the walls. Crystal prisms dangled from lamp shades, from wall sconces, from chandeliers, from gaslamps, catching colors, refracting rainbows that flashed like lightning whenever sunlight managed to steal through the lace curtains.<br><br>We had a fireplace in every room. There were eight of marble, many of elegantly carved wood and none were made of brick. Brick was not elegant enough for our type of house that seemed to despise simplicity.<br><br>Our ceilings were high, and carved with elaborate designs, making frames for Biblical or romantic scenes. In the olden days people had, or so it seemed to my young eyes, either too many clothes on, or too little that wanted to stay in place. I wondered why the Biblical scenes usually had more flesh showing than the ones where people were decidedly wicked. One could hardly believe those near-naked people were sincerely trying to follow where God would lead them.<br><br>Bare bosoms of impressive proportions protruded brazenly in every room of our house but mine. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and several other dead-eyed presidents gazed day after day at the naked lady lying on a chaise across the way as she forever dropped grapes into her gaping mouth. Naked baby boys flew about shamelessly shooting aimless arrows. But the men always modestly hid their maleness behind some strategically placed leaf or graceful flow of drapery. Women were not so apt to hide what they had, I'd often thought as I gazed at them. They looked shy, but acted bold. Aunt Ellsbeth had come up behind me once and explained bitterly that since most artists were men, it was only natural for them to delight in "exploiting" the nude female figure.<br><br>"Don't judge women by what you see in paintings and statues. Judge them only by what you yourself know about the women in your life. The day any man understands any woman will be the day the world comes to an end. Men are hateful, contrary creatures who say they want goddesses to put on pedestals. Once they have them up there, they rip off the halo, tear off the gown, slice off the wings so they can't fly and then kick the pedestal away so the woman falls at his feet and he can scream out as he kicks her, tramp! -- or worse."<br><br>To hear my aunt Ellsbeth talk one would think she'd been married a dozen or more times, and one thousand men had disappointed her. As far as I knew, only one man had.<br><br>Our furniture had many styles, all of them fancy. It seemed each chair, each table, each sofa, lamp, pillow, hassock, desk was in competition, trying to o...</p><h2>Garfield Sits Around the House</h2><p>He&#39;s the #1 champ at sleeping, eating, and watching TV--and when the world&#39;s favorite cat sits around the house, he REALLY sits around the house!

It was taken up a decade later by Japan&#x2019;s Vou Club and then by Charles Henri Ford, who created the chainpoem, composed by poets who mailed their lines all over the world. After WW II, the Beat writers&#x2019; collaborative experiments resulted in the famous <i>Pull My Daisy.</i> The concept was embraced in the 1970s by feminist poets as a way to find a collective female voice. Yet, for all its rich history, virtually no collections of collaborative poetry exist. This exhilarating anthology remedies the omission. Featured are poems by two, four, even as many as 18 people in a dizzying array of forms: villanelles to ghazals, sonnets to somonkas, pantoums to haiku, even quizzes, questionnaires, and other nonliterary forms. Collaborators&#x2019; notes accompany many of the poems, giving a fascinating glimpse into the creative process.</p><p>Denise Duhamel&#39;s most recent books are Two and Two and Queen for a Day.

Datus C. Proper, like these acknowledged masters, has something authentically new to say about the art and science of fly-fishing. And like them he has the true writer&#39;s ability to say it with such authority and freshness of style that his book will be read for a long time to come. His thesis is this: that trout flies have been too often considered mainly in terms of pattern (meaning color) rather than design (meaning the way component materials are chosen and assembled) &#39;the difference between the two being&#39;, as Proper puts it, &#39;the difference between painting and architecture&#39;. Design is what controls a fly&#39;s behavior on the water, and to a trout &#39;his food&#39;s behavior is more important than its tint.&#39; The best authority on this subject is, obviously, the trout himself. Hence the title, and hence the author&#39;s ingenious and wonderfully informed attempt to understand and explain just what a trout (particularly a suspicious and well-educated trout) thinks of the flies the fisherman is trying to delude him with....&#34;</p><p></p><h2>The Negro Leagues Book</h2><p>Based on the field&#39;s most prolific, imaginative, and best-known scholars, this ultimate reference work on the Negro Leagues includes a complete register of all the players--3,400 names, with positions and teams from before the turn of the century into the 1950s--annual rosters, in-depth histories, and more than 75 original photographs.</p><p></p><h2>Sorting Out the Mixed Economy: The Rise and Fall of Welfare and Developmental States in the Americas (Histories of Economic Life, 16)</h2><p><p><b>The untold story of how U.S. development efforts in postwar Latin America helped lead to the dismantling of the U.S. welfare state</b></p><p>In the years after 1945, a flood of U.S. advisors swept into Latin America with dreams of building a new economic order and lifting the Third World out of poverty. These businessmen, economists, community workers, and architects went south with the gospel of the New Deal on their lips, but Latin American realities soon revealed unexpected possibilities within the New Deal itself. In Colombia, Latin Americans and U.S. advisors ended up decentralizing the state, privatizing public functions, and launching austere social welfare programs. By the 1960s, they had remade the country&#x2019;s housing projects, river valleys, and universities. They had also generated new lessons for the United States itself. When the Johnson administration launched the War on Poverty, U.S. social movements, business associations, and government agencies all promised to repatriate the lessons of development, and they did so by multiplying the uses of austerity and for-profit contracting within their own welfare state. A decade later, ascendant right-wing movements seeking to dismantle the midcentury state did not need to reach for entirely new ideas: they redeployed policies already at hand.</p><p>In this groundbreaking book, Amy Offner brings readers to Colombia and back, showing the entanglement of American societies and the contradictory promises of midcentury statebuilding. The untold story of how the road from the New Deal to the Great Society ran through Latin America, <i>Sorting Out the Mixed Economy</i> also offers a surprising new account of the origins of neoliberalism.</p></p><p>This book traces the origins of US developmentalist policies back to midcentury Latin America, and it shows how these ideas and practices were brought back from places like Colombia to the US and eventually used to dismantle the welfare state.<b>Amy C.

I must have forgotten to shut the kitchen door last night. Punishment for coming home drunk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go away,&#x201d; I groaned. Delilah mewed and butted me with her head. I tried to bury my face in the pillow but she continued rubbing herself against my ear, and eventually I rolled over and heartlessly pushed her off the bed.<br> <br>She thumped to the floor with an indignant little meep and I pulled the duvet over my head, but even through the covers I could hear her scratching at the bottom of the door, rattling it in its frame.<br> <br>The door was closed.<br> <br>I sat up, my heart suddenly thumping, and Delilah leaped onto my bed with a glad little chirrup, but I snatched her to my chest, stilling her movements, listening.<br> <br>I might well have forgotten to shut the kitchen door, or I could even have knocked it to without closing it properly. But my bedroom door opened outward&#x2014;a quirk of the weird layout of my flat. There was no way Delilah could have shut herself inside. Someone must have closed it.<br> <br>I sat, frozen, holding Delilah&#x2019;s warm, panting body against my chest and trying to listen.<br> <br>Nothing.<br> <br>And then, with a gush of relief, it occurred to me&#x2014;she&#x2019;d probably been hiding under my bed and I&#x2019;d shut her inside with me when I came home. I didn&#x2019;t remember closing my bedroom door, but I might have swung it absently shut behind me when I came in. To be honest, everything from the tube station onwards was a bit of a blur. The headache had started to set in on the journey home, and now that my panic was wearing off, I could feel it starting up again in the base of my skull. I really needed to stop drinking midweek. It had been okay in my twenties, but I just couldn&#x2019;t shake off the hangovers like I used to.<br> <br>Delilah began squirming uneasily in my arms, digging her claws into my forearm, and I let her go while I reached for my dressing gown and belted it around myself. Then I scooped her up, ready to sling her out into the kitchen.<br> <br>But when I opened the bedroom door, there was a man standing there.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no point in wondering what he looked like, because, believe me, I went over it about twenty-five times with the police. &#x201c;Not even a bit of skin around his wrists?&#x201d; they kept saying. No, no, and no. He had a hoodie on, and a bandanna around his nose and mouth, and everything else was in shadow. Except for his hands.<br> <br>On these he was wearing latex gloves. It was that detail that scared the shit out of me. Those gloves said, &#x201c;I know what I&#x2019;m doing.&#x201d; They said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve come prepared.&#x201d; They said, &#x201c;I might be after more than your money.&#x201d;<br> <br>We stood there for a long second, facing each other, his shining eyes locked on to mine.<br> <br>About a thousand thoughts raced through my mind: Where the hell is my phone? Why did I drink so much last night? I would have heard him come in if I&#x2019;d been sober. Oh Christ, I wish Judah was here.<br> <br>And most of all&#x2014;those gloves. Oh my God, those gloves. They were so professional. So clinical.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t speak. I didn&#x2019;t move. I just stood there, my ratty dressing gown gaping, and I shook. Delilah wriggled out of my unresisting hands and shot away up the hallway to the kitchen, and I just stood there, shaking.<br> <br>Please, I thought. Please don&#x2019;t hurt me.<br> <br>Oh God, where was my phone?<br> <br>Then I saw something in the man&#x2019;s hands. My handbag&#x2014;my new Burberry handbag, although that detail seemed monumentally unimportant. There was only one thing that mattered about that bag. My mobile was inside.<br> <br>His eyes crinkled in a way that made me think he might be smiling beneath the bandanna, and I felt the blood drain from my head and my fingers, pooling in the core of my body, ready to fight or flee, whichever it had to be.<br> <br>He took a step forwards.<br> <br>&#x201c;No&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; I said. I wanted it to sound like a command, but it came out like a plea&#x2014;my voice small and squeaky and quavering pathetically with fear. &#x201c;N&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>But I didn&#x2019;t even get to finish. He slammed the bedroom door in my face, hitting my cheek.<br> <br>For a long moment I stood, frozen, holding my hand to my face, speechless with the shock and pain. My fingers felt ice-cold, but there was something warm and wet on my face, and it took a moment for me to realize it was blood, that the molding on the door had cut my cheek.<br> <br>I wanted to run back to bed, to shove my head under the pillows and cry and cry. But a small, ugly voice in my skull kept saying, He&#x2019;s still out there. What if he comes back? What if he comes back for you?<br> <br>There was a sound from out in the hall, something falling, and I felt a rush of fear that should have galvanized me but instead paralyzed me. Don&#x2019;t come back. Don&#x2019;t come back. I realized I was holding my breath, and I made myself exhale, long and shuddering, and then slowly, slowly, I forced my hand out towards the door.<br> <br>There was another crash in the hallway outside, breaking glass, and with a rush I grabbed the knob and braced myself, my bare toes dug into the old, gappy floorboards, ready to hold the door closed as long as I could. I crouched there, against the door, hunched over with my knees to my chest, and I tried to muffle my sobs with my dressing gown while I listened to him ransacking the flat and hoped to God that Delilah had run out into the garden, out of harm&#x2019;s way.<br> <br>At last, after a long time, I heard the front door open and shut, and I sat there, crying into my knees and unable to believe he&#x2019;d really gone. That he wasn&#x2019;t coming back to hurt me. My hands felt numb and painfully stiff, but I didn&#x2019;t dare let go of the handle.<br> <br>I saw again those strong hands in the pale latex gloves.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know what would have happened next. Maybe I would have stayed there all night, unable to move. But then I heard Delilah outside, mewing and scratching at the other side of the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Delilah,&#x201d; I said hoarsely. My voice was trembling so much I hardly sounded like myself. &#x201c;Oh, Delilah.&#x201d;<br> <br>Through the door I heard her purr, the familiar, deep, chainsaw rasp, and it was like a spell had been broken.<br> <br>I let my cramped fingers loosen from the doorknob, flexing them painfully, and then stood up, trying to steady my trembling legs, and turned the door handle.<br> <br>It turned. In fact it turned too easily, twisting without resistance under my hand, without moving the latch an inch. He&#x2019;d removed the spindle from the other side.<br> <br>Fuck.<br> <br>Fuck, fuck, fuck.<br> <br>I was trapped.</p><h2>Blood Orange (China Bayles Mystery)</h2><p><b>In the newest China Bayles Mystery in the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling series, China comes to the aid of a nurse who ends up in the hospital...</b><br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s mid-April in Pecan Springs, and China is renting her guest cottage to Kelly Kaufman, who needs a temporary place to live as she contends with a very acrimonious divorce from her husband Rich.

His many awards and honors include the <em>Washington Post</em>&#x2014;Children's Book Guild Award for overall contribution to nonfiction for children and the Eva L. Gordon Award for outstanding children's science literature. He has also written and illustrated numerous ALA Notable Books and Outstanding Science Books. Home base for the Arnoskys is a two-hundred-year-old farmhouse in northern Vermont. Their daughters and their families live nearby.</p>Readers familiar with Arnosky's Drawing from Nature and Sketching Outdoors in Spring will find more incisive instructions as they follow the artist's path, winding its way like a snake in the hot summer sun. Some of the sketches are done on fishing trips "between casts for trout and bass." Graphic depictions of small details are supplemented with impressionistic strokes of wide pencil lines when the mass of green is seen merely as "a chaos of lines, shapes, and shadows." The ordered structure of the picture is observed only after the work is finished. And "hide your eraser," the artist advises, "there are no mistakes to be made." Motion, noise, cooling rain and scorching heat also are not to be absorbed by the artistnot even the noise of the carpenter-pencil scratching along the surface of the paper. With varying degrees of complexity and usefulness, Arnosky's instructions are imparted here to convey the need to "feel" first, then sketch, nature's seasonal passage through time. For some, looking beyond the hand-and-eye technique may prove invaluable; while able; while others may want to find their own path through the outdoors.

"Mr. Helin, represents part of an emergent wave of aboriginal thinkers and leaders who have begun publicly rejecting the status quo, wherein bands have been conditioned to seek sustenance from without -- Ottawa -- rather than from within, and instead calls for a reawakening of ancient aboriginal ideals of self-sufficiency..........To be sure, some of these ideas and the politically incorrect opinions of reformers such as Mr. Helin and Mr. Brazeau are frequently at odds with those of the establishment, epitomized by the Assembly of First Nations, and they remain outside the mainstream -- for now. But for a number of reasons, the moment for a new movement of aboriginal thinkers and leaders may have finally arrived. Canadians now face a series of economic and demographic factors threatening to conspire shortly in a way that would make the long-standing troubles on Canada's reserves tenable no more."<p>The National Post-January 08 "...sugarcoating nothing.

Haunted by Custer's ghost, and also by his ability to see into the memories and futures of legendary men like Sioux war-chief Crazy Horse, Paha Sapa's long life is driven by a dramatic vision he experienced as a boy in his people's sacred Black Hills. In August of 1936, a dynamite worker on the massive Mount Rushmore project, Paha Sapa plans to silence his ghost forever and reclaim his people's legacy-on the very day FDR comes to Mount Rushmore to dedicate the Jefferson face.</p><p>Black Hills is an important and revelatory novel, the most singular accomplishment to date by the always unpredictable Dan Simmons. With empathy and great narrative power, it illuminates a significant chapter in the nation's history, and takes us deep into the heart of an extraordinary American life.The story begins at the Battle of Little Big Horn in June of 1876. Eleven-year-old Paha Sapa (whose name, in the Lakota dialect, means &#x201c;Black Hills&#x201d;), is present at the precise moment of Custer's death, a moment that will have enormous ramifications. The narrative that follows encompasses eighty years of highly charged history and ranges from the eponymous (and sacred) Black Hills of South Dakota to the Dust Bowls of the Great Depression to the emerging face of Mount Rushmore, where an astonishing revelation awaits.On one level, Black Hills is a story of profound and inescapable loss: of family, of cultural heritage, of the ancient gods that once dominated the Lakota's world. On another, it is a visionary account of love, hope, and unexpected discovery, and a meditation on the Mystery that lies &#x201c;at the heart of the heart of the universe.&#x201d; Absorbing, moving, and constantly surprising, Black Hills is, by any standard, a major novel, another landmark achievement in a constantly evolving career.Dan Simmons is the award-winning author of several novels, including the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <em>The Terror </em>and <em>Drood</em>.

Bill Irwin may remain silent in his guest appearances on Sesame Street (as the first Mister Noodle) or on "Northern Exposure" (as a circus performer), but his voice is worth hearing. In the fourth of the classic Hardy Boys Mysteries, a series of scuffles at the local shantytown lead Frank and Joe Hardy into an underworld of stolen goods and bank robberies. The Hardy brothers' friends, Chet and Biff, are missing, probably abducted. This seventy-five-year-old series has taken a bad rap for being dated and trite, but, due in large part to Irwin's earnest reading, the story still holds up. A full repertoire of music and sound effects are used throughout the story to help push the action and set the atmosphere.

Writing with the intent to expound upon the merits of his American KENPO Martial Arts system, he wrote of it&#39;s many facets as, &#34;a discipline, a way of life, a philosophy, and an art and a science.&#34; With each book intended to offer a unique and exciting adventure into KENPO knowledge, he called the series of five volumes &#34; Infinite Insights Into Kenpo.&#34; Early in 1982, Mr. Parker completed and published the first book in the &#34;Infinite Insights Into Kenpo&#34; series, titled &#34;Mental Stimulation&#34;. He wrote, &#34;I was sensitive to the need of innovations during my early years of training. Analyzing the methods of fighting in Hawaii, the place of my birth and early rearing, verified the unquestionable need for an updated approach to the Martial Arts.&#34; Mr. Parker broke the bonds of tradition and experimented with more logical and practical means of combating modern day methods of fighting. What emerged was, in his own words, &#34;my own interpretation of the Art.&#34; It was this perspective that he introduced in this initial volume and developed and expanded upon through his subsequent works. Mr. Parker introduced an unparalleled number of combative predicaments, indicating the need for several viewpoints. Thee mystic &#34;Universal Pattern&#34;, introduced to the public for the first time some twenty years earlier, was put into context. In an effort to develop and articulate definable qualities in the Martial Arts, he sought to set the backdrop for the unknown to become known, the intangible to become tangible and for the mysticism to disappear.</p><p>The late Sr. Kenpo Grandmaster Ed Parker Sr. known as the Father of American Kenpo Karate and founder of the International Karate Championships in Long Beach, California.

'I have decided,' President Franklin Delano Roosevelt announced, 'that approximately 1,000 refugees should be immediately brought from Italy to this country.' One thousand refugees....For years, refugees knocking on the doors of American consulates abroad had been told, 'You cannot enter America. The quotas are filled.' And, while the quotas remained untouchable ... millions died."<br><br>With this mixture of desperation and hope, Ruth Gruber begins <b>Haven</b>, the inspiring story of one thousand Jewish and Christian refugees brought to sanctuary in America in 1944. As special assistant to Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes, Gruber was selected to carry out this top-secret mission despite the objections of military brass who doubted the thirty-three-year-old woman's qualifications. When Gruber met the gaunt survivors, they told her about hiding in sewers and forests, of risking their lives to save others. As she wrote down their stories, tears often wiped out the words in her notebook. <br><br>Gruber became the refugees' guardian angel during the dangerous crossing of the U-boat-haunted Atlantic, and during their eighteen-month internment at a former army camp in Oswego, New York. Lobbying Congress at the end of the war, she also helped the refugees become American citizens. This edition concludes with a new chapter featuring Gruber's look back on her many decades as a crusading journalist, and a special Appendix from the 1946 Congressional Record listing the names of all the camp's residents.<br></p><p>Everyone concerned about courage in a grievous time will want to read <b>Haven</b> . . .

Accompanied by her dog, she begins the terrifying work of survival, and eventually, self-renewal. <i>The Wall</i> is at once a simple and moving chronicle&#x2014;of growing potatoes and beans, of hoping for a calf, of counting matches, of forgetting the taste of sugar and the use of one&#x2019;s name and a disturbing meditation on 20th-century history. Now a major motion picture from Music Box Films, <i>The Wall</i> is a haunting study of what a person can love when everything has been taken away.<p>Marlen Haushofer was born on April 11, 1920 in Frauenstein, a region in Upper Austria. She attended Catholic boarding school in Linz, and studied German literature in Vienna and Graz. Her adult life was spent in Steyr, an old industrial city with a strong working class culture and a history of militancy. She died in 1970.</p><p>Haushofer published the novella <i>The Fifth Year</i> in 1952 and earned her first literary award in 1953. Her first novel, <i>A Handful of Life</i>, was published in 1955. <i>The Wall</i>, published in 1962, is considered her greatest literary achievement. Variously interpreted as an ironic Robinson Crusoe story, a philosophical parable of human isolation, and as dystopian fiction, <i>The Wall</i> is currently recognized for its important place in traditions of feminist fiction. Haushofers&#x2019;s last novel, <i>The Attic</i>, was published in 1969. Her last short story collection, <i>Terrible Faithfulness</i>, brought her the Austrian state prize for literature. She has been translated into several European languages. <i>The Wall</i> is Haushofer&#x2019;s only work available in English.</p></p><h2>Sailor Moon Supers, Vol. 1</h2><p>A graphic novel offers the continuing adventures of Serena and her friends, who use the power of the moon and the planets, as the superhero Sailor Moon and her comrades, to battle the forces of evil</p><p></p><h2>When the Emperor Was Divine</h2><p>Julie Otsuka&#39;s commanding and passionate debut novel explores unfamiliar history - that of Japanese Americans in World War II. With crystalline intensity and precision, Otsuka uses a single family to evoke the deracination of a generation who find themselves interned in their own country. With each chapter flawlessly executed from a different point of view - the mother; the daughter; the son; the family&#39;s return to their home; and the bitter release of their father - she has created a novel of unrelenting economy and suppressed emotion. &#34;When The Emperor Was Divine&#34; is a haunting evocation of a family in wartime and an unmistakably resonant lesson for our times. It heralds the arrival of a singularly gifted new novelist.</p><p>A precise, understated gem of a first novel, Julie Otsuka's <i>When the Emperor Was Divine</i> tells one Japanese American family's story of internment in a Utah enemy alien camp during World War II. We never learn the names of the young boy and girl who were forced to leave their Berkeley home in 1942 and spend over three years in a dusty, barren desert camp with their mother. Occasional, heavily censored letters arrive from their father, who had been taken from their house in his slippers by the FBI one night and was being held in New Mexico, his fate uncertain. But even after the war, when they have been reunited and are putting their stripped, vandalized house back together, the family can never regain its pre-war happiness. Broken by circumstance and prejudice, they will continue to pay, in large and small ways, for the shape of their eyes. <i>When the Emperor Was Divine</i> is written in deceptively tranquil prose, a distillation of injustice, anger, and poetry; a notable debut. <i>--Regina Marler</i>&#x201c;Exceptional. . . .

My copy is certainly dog-eared within an inch of its life. She exhibits the same hilariously self-deprecating grumpy grump from her previous books, but <em>Drinking</em> brings a whole new layer to the Julia Wertz experience. That's right, I said "the Julia Wertz experience" ... which actually sounds more like a carnival ride to be avoided, one that will leave you inexplicably drunk with holes in your clothes.</p> <p>In this book Julia is darker, lugubriously introspective, and dare I say, more vulnerable than in her previous works. Yet she's still really, really, obscenely funny. There aren't many authors working today who can illustrate the pervasive despair that sometimes likes to crash on your couch in your 20s--but Julia Wertz nails this. In fact, you should probably get copies for your parents and other assorted relatives who like to mumble things like "youth is wasted on the young" when you complain about stuff. Maybe reading <em>Drinking at the Movies</em> will kickstart your dumb mom's memory, and she'll remember that being in your 20s is actually kind of lonely.</p> <p>Now I'm depressed. Thanks for nothing, Wertz.</p><p>Julia Wertz was born in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1982 and now lives in Brooklyn, New York.

Donaldson &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Of all the strange, unrelenting stories which surrounded Reave the Just, none expressed his particular oddness of character better than that concerning his kinsman, Jillet of Forebridge. Part of the oddness was this--that Reave and Jillet were so unlike each other that the whole idea of their kinship became difficult to credit. Let it be said without prejudice that Jillet was an amiable fool. No one who was not amiable would have been loved by the cautious people of Forebridge--and Jillet was loved, of that there could be no doubt. Otherwise the townsfolk would never have risked the unpredictable and often spectacular consequences of sending for Reave, merely to inform him that Jillet had disappeared. And no one who was not a fool would have gotten himself into so much trouble with Kelven Divestulata that Kelven felt compelled to dispose of him. In contrast, neither Reave's enemies--of which his exploits had attracted a considerable number--nor his friends would have described him as amiable. Doubtless there were villages across the North Counties, towns perhaps, possibly a city or two, where Reave the Just was admired, even adulated: Forebridge was not among them. His decisions were too wild,his actions too unremitting, to meet the chary approval of the farmers and farriers, millers and masons who had known Jillet from birth. Like a force of nature, he was so far beyond explanation that people had ceased trying to account for him. Instead of wondering why he did what he did--or how he got away with it--the men and women of Forebridge asked themselves how such an implausible individual chanced to be kinsman to Jillet, who was himself only implausible in the degree to which likable character was combined with unreliable judgment. In fact, no one knew for certain that Reave and Jillet were related. Just recently, Jillet had upon occasion referred to Reave as, "Reave the Just, my kinsman." That was the true extent of the information available in Forebridge. Nothing more was revealed on the subject. In an effort to supply the lack, rumor or gossip suggested that Jillet's mother's sister, a woman of another town altogether, had fallen under the seduction of a carnival clown with delusions of grandeur--or, alternatively, of a knight errant incognito--and had given Reave a bastard birth under some pitiful hedgerow, or perhaps in some nameless nunnery, or conceivably in some lord's private bedchamber. But how the strains of blood which could produce Reave had been so entirely suppressed in Jillet, neither rumor nor gossip knew. Still it must have been true that Reave and Jillet were related. When Reave was summoned in Jillet's name, he came. By the time Reave arrived, however, Jillet was beyond knowing whether anyone valued him enough to tell his kinsman what had become of him. How he first began to make his way along the road to Kelven's enmity was never clearly known. Very well, he was a fool, as all men knew--but how had he become enmeshed in folly on this scale? A few bad bargains with usurers were conceivable. A few visits to the alchemists and mages who fed on the fringes of towns like Forebridge throughout the North Counties were conceivable, in fact hardly to be wondered at, especially when Jillet was at the painful age where he was old enough. to want a woman's love but too young to know how to get it. A few minor and ultimately forgettable feuds born of competition for trade or passion were not only conceivable but normal. Had not men and women been such small and harmless fools always? The folk of Forebridge might talk of such matters endlessly, seeking to persuade themselves that they were wiser. But who among them would have hazarded himself against Kelven Divestulata? Indeed, who among them had not at one time or anothersuspected that Kelven was Satan Himself, thinly disguised by swarthy flesh and knotted muscle and wiry beard? What in the name of all the saints had possessed Jillet to fling himself into such deep waters? The truth--which no one in Forebridge ever divined--was that Jillet brought his doom down on his own head by the simple expedient of naming himself Reave's kinsman. It came about in this fashion. In his early manhood, Jillet fell victim to an amiable, foolish, and quite understandable passion for the widow Huchette. Before his death, Rudolph Huchette had brought his new bride--foreign, succulent, and young--to live in the manor-house now occupied by Kelven Divestulata, thinking that by keeping her far from the taints and sophistication of the cities he could keep her pure. Sadly for him, he did not live long enough after settling in Forebridge to learn that his wife was pure by nature and needed no special protection. And of course the young men of the town knew nothing of her purity. They only knew that she was foreign, young, and bereaved, imponderably delicious. Jillet's passion was only one among many, ardent and doomed. The widow Huchette asked only of the God who watched over innocence that she be left alone. Needless to say, she was not. Realistically considered, the only one of her admirers truly capable of disturbing her was dour Kelven. When she spurned his advances, he laid siege to her with all the cunning bitterness of his nature. Over the course of many months, he contrived to install himself in the manor-house which Rudolph had intended as her lifelong home; he cut off her avenues of escape so that her only recourse was to accept the drudgery of being his housekeeper since she steadfastly refused the grim honor of being his wife. And even there he probably had the best of her, since he was no doubt perfectly capable of binding and raping her to satisfy his admiration. However, Jillet and the other men enamored of the widow did not consider her circumstances--and their own--realistically. As men in passion will, they chose to believe that they themselves were the gravest threat to her detachment. Blind to Kelven's intentions, Jillet and his fellow fools went about in a fog of schemes, dreaming of ways to persuade her to reveal her inevitable preference for themselves. However, Jillet carried this scheming further than most--but by no means all--of his peers. Perhaps because of his amiability--or perhaps because he was foolish--he was not ordinarily successful in competitions over women. His face and form were goodly enough, and his brown eyes showed pleasure as openly as any man's. His kindness and cheery temper endeared him throughout Forebridge. But he lacked forthrightness, self-assertion; he lacked the qualities which inspired passion. As with women everywhere, those of Forebridge valued kindness; they were fond of it; but they did not surrender their virtue to it. They preferred heroes--or rogues. So when Jillet first conceived his passion for the widow Huchette, he was already accustomed to the likelihood that he would not succeed. Like Kelven Divestulata after the first year or so of the widow's bereavement--although no one in Forebridge knew at the time what Kelven was doing--Jillet prepared a siege. He was not wise enough to ask himself, Why am I not favored in the beds of women? What must I learn in order to make myself desirable? How may I rise above the limitations which nature has placed upon me? Instead, he asked, Who can help me with this woman? His answer had already occurred to a handful of his brighter, but no less foolish, fellows. In consequence, he was no better than the fifth or sixth man of Forebridge to approach the best-known hedgerow alchemist in the County, seeking a love-potion. According to some authorities, the chief distinction between alchemists and mages was that the former had more opportunities for charlatanism, at less hazard. Squires and earls consulted mages: plowmen and cotters, alchemists. Certainly, the man whom Jillet approached was a charlatan. He admitted as much freely in the company of folk who were wise enough not to want anything from him. But he would never have revealed the truth about himself to one such as Jillet. Charlatan or not, however, he was growing weary of this seemingly endless sequence of men demanding love-potions against the widow Huchette. One heartsick swain by the six-month or so may be profitably bilked. Three may be a source of amusement. But five or six in a season was plainly tedious. And worrisome as well: even Forebridge was capable of recognizing charlatanism when five or six love-potions failed consecutively. "Go home," the alchemist snapped when he had been told what Jillet wanted. "The ingredients for the magick you require are arduous and expensive to obtain. I cannot satisfy you." But Jillet, who could not have put his hand on five farthings at that moment, replied, "I care nothing for the price. I will pay whatever is needed." The dilemma of cost had never entered his head, but he was certain it could be resolved. The widow Huchette had gold enough, after all. His confidence presented an entirely different dilemma to the alchemist. It was not in the nature of charlatans to refuse money. And yet too many love-potions had already been dispensed. If Providence did not inspire the widow to favor one of the first four or five men, the alchemist's reputation--and therefore his income--would be endangered. Perhaps even his person would be endangered. Seeking to protect himself, the alchemist named a sum which should have stunned any son of a cotter. Jillet was not stunned. Any sum was acceptable, since he had no prospect of ever paying it himself. "Very well," he said comfortably. Then, because he wished to believe in his own cleverness, he added, "But if the potion does not succeed, you will return that sum with interest." "Oh, assuredly," replied the alchemist, who found that he could not after all refuse money. "All of my magicks succeed, or I will know the reason why. Return tomorrow. Bring your gold then." He closed his door so that Jillet would not have a chance to change his mind. Jillet walked home musing to himself. Now that he had time to consider the matter, he found that he had placed himself in an awkward position. True, the love of the widow Huchette promised to be a valuable investment--but it was an investment only, not coin. The alchemist would require coin. In fact, the coin was required in order to obtain the investment. And Jillet had no coin, not on the scale the alchemist had mentioned. The truth was that he had never laid mortal eyes on that scale of coin. And he had no prospects which might be stretched to that scale, no skills which could earn it, no property which could be sold for it. Where could a man like Jillet of Forebridge get so much money? Where else? Congratulating himself on his clarity of wit, Jillet went to the usurers. He had had no dealings with usurers heretofore. But he had heard rumors. Some such "lenders" were said to be more forgiving than others, less stringent in their demands. Well, Jillet had no need of anyone'sforgiveness; but he felt a natural preference for men with amiable reputations. From the honest alchemist, he went in search of an amiable usurer. Unfortunately, amiable, forgiving usurers had so much kindness in their natures because they could afford it; and they could afford it because their investments were scantly at risk: they demanded collateral before hazarding coin. This baffled Jillet more than a little. The concept of collateral he could understand--just--but he could not understand why the widow Huchette did not constitute collateral. He would use the money to pay the alchemist; the alchemist would give him a love-potion; the potion would win the widow; and from the widow's holdings the usurer would be paid. Where was the fallacy in all this? The usurer himself had no difficulty detecting the fallacy. More in sorrow than in scorn, he sent Jillet away. Other "lenders" were similarly inclined. Only their pity varied, not their rejection. Well, thought Jillet, I will never gain the widow without assistance. I must have the potion. So he abandoned his search for an amiable usurer and committed himself, like a lost fish, to swim in murkier waters. He went to do business with the kind of moneylender who despised the world because he feared it. This moneylender feared the world because his substance was always at risk; and his substance was always at risk because he required no collateral. All he required was a fatal return on his investment. "One fifth!" Jillet protested. The interest sounded high, even to him. "No other lender in Forebridge asks so much." "No other lender in Forebridge," wheezed the individual whose coin was endangered, "risks so much." True, thought Jillet, giving the man his due. And after all one fifth was only a number. It would not amount to much, if the widow were won swiftly. "Very well," he replied calmly. "As you say, you ask no collateral. And my prospects cannot fail. One fifth in a year is not too much to pay for what I will gain, especially"--he cleared his throat in a dignified fashion, for emphasis--"since I will only need the use of your money for a fortnight at most." "A <i>year</i>?" The usurer nearly burst a vessel. "You will return me one fifth <i>a week</i> on my risk, or you can beg coin of fools like yourself, for you will get none from me!" One fifth in a week. Perhaps for a moment Jillet was indeed stunned. Perhaps he went so far as to reconsider the course he had chosen. One fifth in a week, each and every week--And what if the potion failed? Or if it was merely slow? He would never be able to pay that first one fifth, not to mention the second or the third--and certainly not the original sum itself. Why, it was ruinous. But then it occurred to him that one fifth, or two fifths, or twenty would make no difference to the wealth of the widow Huchette. And he would be happy besides, basking in the knowledge of a passion virtuously satisfied. On that comfortable assumption, he agreed to the usurer's terms. The next day, laden with a purse containing more gold than he had ever seen in his life, Jillet of Forebridge returned to the alchemist. By this time, the alchemist was ready for him. The essence of charlatanism was cunning, and the alchemist was nothing if not an essential charlatan. He had taken the measure of his man--as well as of his own circumstances--and had determined his response. First, of course, he counted out Jillet's gold, testing the coins with spurious powders and honest teeth. He produced a few small fires and explosions, purely for effect: like most of his ilk, he could be impressive when he wished. Then he spoke. "Young man, you are not the first to approach me for a potion in this matter. You are merely the first"--he hefted the purse--"to place such value on your object. Therefore I must give you a magick able to supersede all others--a magick not only capable of attaining its end, but in fact of doing so against the opposition of a--number--of intervening magicks. This is a rare and dangerous enterprise. For it to succeed, you must not only trust it entirely, but also be bold in support of it. "Behold!" The alchemist flourished his arms to induce more fires and explosions. When an especially noxious fume had cleared, he held in his palm a leather pouch on a thong. "I will be plain," said the alchemist, "for it will displease me gravely if magick of such cost and purity fails because you do not do your part. This periapt must be worn about your neck, con...</p><h2>Madeleine Cooks</h2><p>Features more than two hundred taste-tempting recipes for easy-to-prepare salads, grain, fish, and chicken dishes, variations of steak and potatoes, lamb, pork, and various pizzas, pastries, pastas, cakes and puddings</p><p>Madeleine Kamman has been a four-star restaurateur, a PBS cooking show host, and co-founder and director of The School for American Chefs, a graduate program for professional chefs.

But the park shown here seems no more dangerous than life itself, and no less filled with beauty, charming incident, excess, jokes in questionable taste, unintended consequence, and pathos, truly described. One might say that no artist has done so much for this piece of land since Frederick Law Olmstead." --<i>John Szarkowski, The Museum of Modern Art, New York</i><br>After receiving a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1977, Tod Papageorge began to photograph intensively in Central Park, employing medium-format cameras rather than the 35mm Leicas that he had used since moving to New York in 1965. These pictures, gathered in <i>Passing Through Eden</i>, convey the passion that--as Rosalind Krauss once described it in Papageorge's work--embraces "the sensuous richness of physical reality, that fullness which Baudelaire called intimacy when he meant eroticism." From picture to picture, Papageorge constructs a world that resembles our own, but that also invokes that of the Bible: <i>Passing Through Eden</i> is sequenced to parallel, in its opening pages, the first chapters of Genesis--from the Creation through the (metaphorical) generations that follow on from Cain--before giving over to a virtuosic run of pictures that, as he expresses it in his illuminating afterword to the book, picks up "the threads that tie the Bible to Chaucer, Shakespeare and "Page Six" of the <i>New York Post</i>." This ambitious body of work--incorporating pictures produced over the course of 25 years--displays not only Papageorge's remarkable ability to make photographs that read like condensed narratives, but also his skill at weaving them into sequences that echo profound cultural narratives. It challenges the reader to succumb (or not) to the pleasures of the "fullness" of each individual photograph, while ignoring (or not) the tug of a tale demanding to be told. Like Eden itself, this book sets our desire for beauty against that of knowledge, even as it reminds us of some of the ways that we read, and come to know, books.</p><p><b>From alecsoth.com:</b> <br> "The reason for all of my attention to <i>Passing Through Eden</i> is simple - I think it is a great book. But more to the point, it is the kind of book I aspire to make...My primary goal as a photographer is to make a great book within the tradition of literary photo books (The Americans, Treadwell). So when I encounter a new book that achieves that status, I want to know more." <br> <b>-Alec Soth</b></p><h2>Washington Irving: An American Original</h2><p>The first American writer to make his pen his primary means of support, Washington Irving rocketed to fame at the age of 26. In 1809 he published A History of New York under the pseudonym Diedrich Knickerbocker to great acclaim. The public&#39;s appetite for all things Irving was insatiable; his name alone guaranteed sales. At the time, he was one of the most famous men in the world, a friend of Dickens, Hawthorne, and Longfellow, as well as Astor, Van Buren, and Madison. But his sparkling public persona was only one side of this gentleman author. In brilliant, meticulous strokes, Brian Jay Jones renders Washington Irving in all his flawed splendor - someone who fretted about money and employment, sufferedfrom writer&#39;s block, and doggedly cultivated his reputation. Jones offers as never before a very human portrait of the often contrasting public and private lives of this true American original.</p><p>Brian Jay Jones served as a speechwriter, ghostwriter, and policy analyst for two U.S. senators. A former associate superintendent of education in Arizona, he now works as a writer and policy analyst. He lives with his wife and daughter in Damascus, Maryland.Policy analyst and speechwriter Jones traces the life of America's first bona-fide best-selling author, following Washington Irving (1783&#x2013;1859) through his childhood in a religious home in New York, his entry into law, the death of his fianc�e, his years abroad and, of course, his writing career. Some of the most interesting sections describe Irving's interactions with other writers, like Poe and Dickens. Irving emerges as a man with a deep need for praise and affirmation. He was especially worried that living in Europe for so many years would cost him his American readership. Jones does not argue that Irving was a truly great writer; rather, he gives him a great deal of credit for being the first American to figure out how to make a living as an author. There were no models, no one to guide him through the arcane details of international copyright. But this biography is unsophisticated in both the writing and portrayal of Irving: for instance, is there really the deep conflict Jones posits between Irving's being publicly charming and privately petty?

Hunter (Sociology and Religious Studies/Univ. of Virginia; American Evangelicalism, 1983) uses historical references to religious battles throughout American history to show how yesterday's ecumenical divisions among Catholics, Protestants, and Jews have become realigned in recent years. Through debates about slavery, the Scopes trial, and the influence of deism on the Constitution, he elaborates on the ``new lines of conflict'' through the eyes of both clergy members and the more ``humanist'' intelligentsia. Hunter is adept at demonstrating how the battles are now between ``orthodox'' and ``progressive'' camps within faiths, and how political mine fields like gay rights, Roe v. Wade, and the ordination of women into the priesthood prompt a nagging concern over the roles of churches and synagogues in American life. The author has a pervasive regard for the role of family--possibly ``the beginning and end of contemporary culture'' since its dissolution may prove fatal to our social order. He also illustrates how the classic dualism between God and Satan has been transformed into an often unscrupulous intrigue between traditionalists and ``secular humanists.'' But Hunter betrays a possible bias regarding homosexuality. Here, the anti-gay ``convictions'' of a Jerry Falwell are treated as more worthy of serious debate than the fulminations against the ``evils'' of race- mixing or ``the Jewish Menace.'' In the end, Hunter seems to favor religious thinking over nontranscendental doctrines. Though giving short shrift to the secular viewpoint, Hunter still provides an informative look at America's ambiguous spiritual character. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

No revisionist, Groom delivers the traditional worshipful portrait of General MacArthur while admitting he made several key blunders that doomed the Philippines in the year's early months. In May the two fleets met in the Coral Sea. While the Japanese came out ahead, they abandoned their invasion of New Guinea, and Groom follows the standard account of calling it an American victory. He adds that brains and luck win more battles than courage, providing a perfect illustration in Midway, fought in June 1942. Having broken Japan's naval code, American forces surprised a vastly superior Japanese fleet and sank all four of its carriers. In August, the First Marine Division was deposited on an obscure island, Guadalcanal, then hastily retreated. For the next four months, in what is the book's highlight, the marines fought with epic heroism against repeated efforts to expel them. Almost as an afterthought, Groom shows American forces taking their first step against Germany, landing in North Africa in November and quickly bogging down. Heroism was not in short supply, but much of it occurred in 1943. A talented writer, Groom has written a page-turner; readers needing an introduction will love it. <i>Agent, Theron Raines. (May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.The first few months of 1942 saw perhaps the greatest threat in history to the survival of liberal democratic societies. In the Pacific, the American fleet had been devastated at Pearl Harbor, Singapore had fallen, and Japan seemed invulnerable behind a military screen stretching for thousands of miles. In Europe, Hitler had established Fortress Europe. But by the end of the year, the tide had clearly turned. The Japanese advance had been halted at Midway and the Coral Sea, the Afrika Corps had been defeated at El Alamein, and German forces were bogged down at Stalingrad. Groom is both a celebrated novelist (<i>Forrest Gump</i>, 1994) and historian, and he brings his skills as a master storyteller to chronicle the great events and the men, both powerful and ordinary, who pulled our societies back from the abyss. Groom sets the stage by showing both the confusion and bravery as Americans were defeated at Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, and his account of the subsequent death marches is heartbreaking. In recounting the steady recovery and then advances of Allied arms, Groom intersperses experiences of individual soldiers and sailors with the broader strategic picture. This is a superb work of popular history that is a worthy addition to World War II collections. <i>Jay Freeman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Eliot Spitzer led to his resignation, this memoir adds little insight. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

These problems have interfered with many students&#39; study and understanding of the Course. In response to these difficulties, Forgiveness and Jesus addresses the misunderstandings of traditional Christianity, separating these out from the teachings of the Course, and emphasizes the importance of correcting these errors in the context of the two-thousand-year-old tradition. Forgiveness and Jesus first discusses in depth the principles of A Course in Miracles, specifically focusing on the dynamics of the ego and the meaning of forgiveness. The book next presents the teachings of Christianity in the light of the principles of the Course, highlighting the similarities and differences. Throughout the book, special attention is given to the application of the Course&#39;s principles to important areas in our lives such as injustice, anger, sickness, sexuality, and money. The person of Jesus is also discussed in depth. The Appendix includes an index of names, a subject index, an index of examples, and a scriptural index.</p><p></p><h2>Hunger (Picador)</h2><p>Book by Hamsun, Knut</p><p>Knut Hamsun (1859-1952) was a Norwegian novelist, poet, and playwright. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920. His other works include <i>Pan</i>, <i>Women at the Pump</i>, and <i>Mysteries</i>. <br>Text: English, Norwegian (translation)</p><h2>Hiroshige; the 53 stations of the Tokaido, (Masterworks of Ukiyo-e)</h2><p>The Tokaido -- the name of this highway today epitomizes a golden age of Japan&#39;s past. This &#34;Eastern Sea Road&#34;, which connected the emperor&#39;s capital in Kyoto and the seat of the shogun&#39;s administration in Edo (now Tokyo) was heavily traveled in all seasons; the numerous prints and guidebooks about the Tokaido represent the time of prosperity and peace when even the average citizen could undertake the adventure of travel along this highway. It was Hiroshige who immortalized the Tokaido. In the famous prints of the fifty-three stages reproduced in this book, this master artist of the ukiyo-e print captured the beauty, romance, adventure, mystery, and joy - all the myriad and glowing facets of the people and places, in all seasons and times of day, of the Tokaido highway. Hiroshige&#39;s Tokaido prints became an immediate success in his own time; today they are included among the art masterpieces of the world. The success of Hiroshige&#39;s first Tokaido series was so great that he followed with other versions of the same theme. This is the first book to present selected masterpieces from three other Tokaido series by Hiroshige, alongside the original fifty-five prints published by Hoeido, all in full color. In all his work one sees the same vibrant poetry, the love of the countryside and the people, the concern with the beauty of seasonal change and the forces of nature in sun, rain, mist and snow. The modern reader here is presented with an immortal, pictorial travel guide through a world of beauty and color that captures the essence of a land and its people.</p><p>Text: English, Japanese (translation)</p><h2>Escaping The Self: Alcoholism, Spirituality, Masochism, Other Flights From Burden Of Selfhood</h2><p>Based on the latest research in the field of social psychology, the author investigates the avenues of escape, from alcoholism to meditation, Americans are taking to cope with the pressures of modern life</p><p>A perceptive study of modern culture's overriding fascination with the self and identity. Baumeister (Psychology/Case Western Reserve Univ.) states that the history of the self in Western culture began by equating it simply with the physical body; the self has now grown to be regarded as vast, unique, important--containing personality traits, the wellsprings of creativity, the keys to personal fulfillment, and the solution to life's dilemmas (all of which is absurd to cultures that don't share our zealous faith in the inner self). The more inflated this self, Baumeister argues, the more burdensome it becomes: In the wake of calamity, or to escape its demands, people flee from it. For example, says Baumeister, bulimics, painfully preoccupied with themselves and the way they look to others, go on binges to escape their tyrannical self- images. During a binge, meaningful thought is abandoned for a narrow focus on immediate sensations; the troubled self disappears from awareness by becoming preoccupied with one cookie after another. In masochism--most common among successful, individualistic people at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy- -the competent, virtuous, energetic, and decisive selves these people maintain are gratefully relinquished by submission to the master. And, through pain, the self is reduced to the body, and the world is shrunk to one's immediate surroundings. Baumeister notes that the cult of self-esteem--which has so raised people's expectations and obligations (looking better, making love better, success at work, play, dieting and saying clever things)--will be dangerous in the long run as they try, through aberrant behaviors, to escape this self-imposed despotism. And perhaps self-esteem in itself is not always desirable. ``Weren't self- importance and overconfidence two of the factors that embroiled the US in Vietnam?'' Baumeister asks. Well written in nontechnical language; unique and persuasive. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He lives in Beverly Hills, California.<b>Foreword: Before You Begin this Book</b> <p> Ten years ago, when I first told a friend that I was writing a book on herbs, he looked startled and said, "Why, Earl, I had no idea that you could cook!" </p><p> Today, his comment seems laughable but, back then, most people still thought that herbs were only something you added to tomato sauce or sprinkled on a salad. </p><p> What a difference a decade makes! </p><p> According to a recent survey, one-third of all Americans today use herbal supplements and related products. Once relegated to a small shelf in the back of the store, herbs now account for about 25 percent of all sales in natural food stores. There are now row upon row of herbal supplements not just where you'd expect to find them -- in natural food stores -- but also in conventional pharmacies, discount stores, supermarkets, and even in doctors' offices. Aspirin and acetaminophen now stand side by side with herbs such as echinacea, goldenseal, kava, valerian, ginseng, and St. John's wort. If, as the saying goes, money talks, Americans are loudly voicing their support for herbal products. In 1994, Americans spent 1.6 billion dollars on herbal preparations; by 1998, that number had nearly tripled, to $4 billion in retail sales. I predict that the market will continue to grow exponentially. </p><p> Sales of herbal products have skyrocketed since Congress passed the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), which radically changed the way supplements can be sold and marketed in the United States. The law lifted decades of regulatory barriers that had made it difficult, if not impossible, to bring new supplements to market. The law also made it easier for manufacturers to make health claims for their products as long as they had scientific backing. If an herb was a proven treatment for cold or headache, the manufacturer could say so on the label. This made it easier than ever for people to find and use the appropriate herbal products. </p><p> The herbal revolution has done nothing less than change the way medicine is being practiced. Once dismissed as quackery, traditional remedies are now getting a close look from mainstream scientists. The United States Congress has established the office of Alternative Medicine under the National Institutes of Health to study alternative medicine, including herbs. Recently, an entire issue of the conservative <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> was devoted to exploring various forms of alternative medicine. So much has happened since the <i>Herb Bible</i> was published in 1992, that it has become necessary to update this book. Not only do I introduce scores of new herbs in this new edition, but I also include the latest scientific findings on herbs that were listed in the old edition. Similar to the old <i>Herb Bible,</i> the new <i>Herb Bible</i> is designed so that it can be used by both the novice and the experienced herbal consumer. </p><p> In a sense, as we embark on a new millennium, we've come full circle. When I was growing up in Canada, my parents often relied on herbs and natural medicine to treat the common illnesses of childhood. However, by the time I started pharmacy school in 1958, the pill-popping era was just dawning. By the time I graduated and entered practice, there seemed to be a pill for whatever ailed us. Have a sore throat? Take an antibiotic. Think a headache is coming on? Reach for an aspirin. Need to drop some weight or pick up some energy? Try amphetamines. Want to calm down? A tranquilizer will help you. This was also the dawn of the space age. The United States was preparing to send a man to the moon in a space capsule. Therefore, it was only logical to believe that we would soon be able to cure the common cold, flu, acne, and various catastrophic illnesses with time-release capsules. The notion that lifestyle, diet, or exercise could possibly influence health was considered unscientific and profoundly silly. "Scientific" remedies were not hard to find, however. They were widely advertised and came packaged in attractive boxes, bottles, or blister packs. Natural remedies -- the kind our grandmothers and great-grandmothers relied on -- were dismissed as pure hokum. These were the days when there seemed to be nothing that nature could do that humans could not do better. </p><p> Against this backdrop, I reluctantly registered for the required course in <i>pharmacognosy,</i> the study of drugs derived from plants. My classmates and I disparagingly called the course "weeds and seeds," and thought that it was utterly weird. We went on field trips and foraged for plants known for their medicinal value. With my own hands, I picked them, dried them, and with an old-fashioned mortar and pestle, turned them into useful drugs. In the process, my skepticism about natural remedies began to fade and I started studying the literature some might call the lore of natural remedies. I was astonished to discover that people had been using natural remedies for thousands of years to successfully treat a wide variety of ills, ranging from heartburn to heart disease. In fact, prior to World War II, herbal medications were listed side-by-side with chemical drugs in the U.S. <i>Pharmacopeia,</i> the official listing of accepted medicines. Even today, nearly 50 percent of the thousands of drugs commonly used and prescribed are either derived from plant sources or contain chemical imitations of plant compounds. The list is impressive: </p><p> </p><ul> <li><i>Digitalis, a potent cardiotonic, is derived from the foxglove plant.</i> </li><li><i>Aspirin is a chemical imitation of salicin, found in the bark of the white willow tree.</i> </li><li><i>Reserpine, a blood pressure medicine, is actually an ancient remedy from India derived from an Asian shrub.</i> </li><li><i>Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, found in many over-the-counter cold remedies, are derived from the ephedra plant, used in China to treat colds and flu for more than five thousand years!</i> </li><li><i>Quinine, a famous malaria treatment, and quinidine, an antiarrhythmic medication, are made from the bark of the cinchona tree.</i> </li><li><i>Vincristine and vinblastine, two of our most successful cancer treatments, are derived from the rosy periwinkle tree, native to southern Madagascar. Medicine derived from this plant has saved the lives of thousands of victims of childhood leukemia.</i> </li><li><i>Taxol, derived from the bark of the Pacific Yew tree, has been used successfully to treat advanced ovarian cancer.</i> </li><li><i>Penicillin, the grandfather of antibiotics, is actually a mold, an organism produced by a fungus, a primitive plant.</i> </li></ul> <p> Thus, I owe my lifelong interest in herbal medicine to the courses I took in pharmacognosy. After graduation, I began collecting antique herbal guides, often called <i>herbals,</i> some of which are more than two centuries old. But I never took my herbals to the pharmacy with me, because herbalism was considered obsolete. Indeed, not long after I graduated, pharmacognosy was dropped from the list of required courses by many pharmacy schools. Ironically, many schools have reintroduced the course and many others are considering it. </p><p> The major reason for the decline in herbalism was not the herbs' inefficacy but economics. Herbs are not as profitable as drugs. In the United States, most herbs are not recognized as drugs or as having any medicinal value. Rather, they are classified as food or food additives. Even if an herb is known to be beneficial as a medicine, it cannot be sold as a drug until it receives the official stamp of approval by the Food and Drug Administration, and approval does not come quickly, easily, or cheaply. Where the introduction of new drugs is concerned, the United States is one of the most restrictive countries in the world. The extensive testing required to achieve official drug status, that is, to prove a substance is safe and effective, can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take many years. This explains why the cost of the average prescription has risen tenfold since 1950! </p><p> Moreover, natural substances cannot be patented. When a pharmaceutical company creates a new drug, the company is given a twenty-year exclusive right to market that product, so that the company can recoup its research and development costs. Were a pharmaceutical company to simply package an herb, the company would receive no such market protection. Thus, there is little incentive to spend time and money investigating the potential benefits of an herb that people can grow themselves or that competitors are free to market. It's not surprising, therefore, that many pharmaceutical houses have lost interest in pursuing plant drugs altogether, and instead have focused their research and development efforts on new synthetic medications. An unfortunate consequence of this shift in emphasis to synthetic drugs was that many time-honored natural remedies were displaced and, at least for a while, forgotten. </p><p> Today, however, we are witnessing a renewed interest in herbal remedies, not only on the part of alternative physicians but from traditional medical practitioners as well. One reason is the recognition that, although synthetic drugs have certainly performed many miracles and saved countless lives, they have not turned out to be the "silver bullet" that pharmacologists hoped they would be. Virtually all of these drugs have well-known side effects, ranging from the unpleasant to the lethal. In many cases, they are not even effective. For example, antibiotics, for all their ability to defeat bacterial infections, are essentially useless against viruses, and many of the diseases that plague us today, from Shanghai flu to AIDS to chronic fatigue syndrome, are viral syndromes. What's even worse is that, due to the overuse of antibiotics, we are now threatened by new and deadlier strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria. One-third of all strains of streptococcus pneumonia are now resistant to one or more antibiotics. Once easily cured by penicillin, 90 percent of all staph infections are now resistant to this antibiotic, and some new strains are resistant to all drugs. </p><p> Another reason for the...</p></p><h2>Teresa Margolles: Ya Basta Hijos de Puta</h2><p><p>Characterized by a minimal yet vivid stylistic grammar and crude realism, the works of Mexican artist Teresa Margolles (born 1963) presented in this monograph contend with the prevalence of death and violence, particularly in contemporary Mexico, investigating them in connection with social and economic inequality.</p></p><p></p><h2>Nez Perce (A First Americans Book)</h2><p>Including quotations from Nez Perce leaders, the story of the Nez Perce Indians--whose name means &#34;pierced nose&#34; and refers to ornaments some tribe members wore--documents their history, creation myth, and customs, and considers the tribe today.</p><p>Ages 5-8.

His illustrations are frequently seen in ROLLING STONE, NEWSDAY, and THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW. He lives in Hong Kong.*Starred Review* Gr. 5-8. In this exquisitely presented parody of a field guide (similar in approach to <i> Dragonology</i>, without the novelty elements), Sierra's controlled text provides a counterweight to artwork that's like graffiti scribbled on the walls of Bedlam. But don't assume Sierra's role is exclusively moderating. In delivering the vital stats of more than 60 monsters, she reveals a deliciously macabre side (one Brazilian beastie "massages his victim's body until it is as soft as a ripe avocado . . . [and] sucks out all his organs"), while layering doses of deadpan humor among the chilling details ("Survival hints" for facing the French grim reaper? "Not applicable."). Some readers may wish for maps locating the monsters' native lands, as well as notes about specific cultural sources. Still, this will delight junior-high readers and older devotees of Terry Jones' <i> Lady Cottington's Pressed Fairy Book</i> (1994) and Edward Gorey's <i> The Gashlycrumb Tinies</i> (1997), who will exult in the Bosch-like envisioning, and then mull over Sierra's endnote about the cautionary purposes served by monster stories.

Here is a rare opportunity to eavesdrop on two cinematic masters from very different backgrounds as they cover each of Hitch's films in succession. Though this book was initially published in 1967 when Hitchcock was still active, Truffaut later prepared a revised edition that covered the final stages of his career. It's difficult to think of a more informative or entertaining introduction to Hitchcock's art, interests, and peculiar sense of humor. The book is a storehouse of insight and witticism, including the master's impressions of a classic like <i>Rear Window</i> ("I was feeling very creative at the time, the batteries were well charged"), his technical insight into <i>Psycho</i>'s shower scene ("the knife never touched the body; it was all done in the [editing]"), and his ruminations on flops such as <i>Under Capricorn</i> ("If I were to make another picture in Australia today, I'd have a policeman hop into the pocket of a kangaroo and yell 'Follow that car!'"). This is one of the most delightful film books in print. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i>Francois Truffaut (1932-1984) was a French film director, screenwriter, producer, actor and film critic.</p><h2>Story of the Thirteen Colonies &amp; the Great Republic Teacher Manual, Second Edition</h2><p>Our new study guide for this course includes important facts, vocabulary, and comprehension questions for each chapter, as well as enrichment activities such as mapwork, drawings, research, writing assignments, and more!

Tour.</p><p><b>James M. Saslow</b>, a graduate of Princeton and Columbia universities, for many years New York Arts Editor for <b>The Advocate</b>, is a professor in the Department of Art at Queens College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. His books include <b>Ganymede in the Renaissance: Homosexuality in Art and Society</b>. He lives in New York City.With over 150 photographs and prints (32 in full color) of homoerotic art, this volume brings together three millennia of queer images into one extraordinary volume, a mini-Louvre dedicated to the various incarnations of homosexuality throughout the centuries. The scope of Saslow, long the New York arts editor of the Advocate and now a professor of art at the CUNY Graduate Center, is all-encompossing: he takes the reader from the classical worlds of Greece and Rome to the present-day streets of New York, from Cretan bronze plaques of the seventh-century b.c. to Tom of Finland's gay erotica of the 1960s. Though Saslow looks primarily at the Western tradition, he also turns his attention to homoerotic art in the Middle East, Asia, and pre-Columbian America. One of this books greatest strengths is that it doesnt attempt to present a purified or sanitized version of homosexuality, nor does it only delineate positive depictions of homoeroticism. Saslow pays close attention to how hostile images, such as those of the Nazis' ``Degenerate Art'' traveling exhibit, play upon stereotypes to demonize gay men and lesbians. What is especially remarkable is how Saslow illuminates his considerations of the artworks with analyses of the social and cultural conditions of the societies which created them. This book doesnt merely cull queer art into a coffee-table book for a prefabricated gay and lesbian audience; it reads the art as a measure of the artists and their cultures. The final result is academic writing at its best: informational for Saslow's fellow art historians, instructive and illuminating (yet not pedantic) for the lay reader. Saslow describes his work as a map, not a close-up, of queer art. With this map in hand, the reader is ready for an exciting and rewarding journey into 3,000 years of homoerotic images, a trip which offers innumerable opportunities to ponder the visual beauty of the queer. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

And why did some books, and not others, come to be collected into what Christians came to consider the canon of scripture that would define their belief for all time? With these 12 lectures, get a fast-moving yet thorough introduction to these and other key issues in the development of Christianity. Designed to deepen the understanding of both Christians and non-Christians alike, this lecture series takes as its perspective the historical, rather than the theological, issues behind the development of the Bible. And it&#39;s an illuminating perspective, indeed, ranging across issues of language, oral history, the physical limitations of spreading the written word at a time when the printing press lay far in the future, and, of course, the theological forces that were shaping Christianity, molding a commonly accepted canon from the various expressions of the faith spreading across the ancient world. Professor Ehrman recreates the context of the times in which the canon was being assembled so that you can understand what the message of each written work would have meant to ancient Christians. You&#39;ll come to see how the diverse books of the New Testament were gathered together into the form we now know, whether it&#39;s the four canonical Gospels (whose authorship was only attributed by later Christians), the book of Acts, the 21 Epistles, or the book of Revelation (sometimes called the Apocalypse of John). These lectures are a compelling introduction not only to the development of the Christian canon, but to all of the forces that would play a role in early Christian history.</p><p></p><h2>Psalms for Praying: An Invitation to Wholeness</h2><p>Every commentary on the Book of Psalms has had to face the issue that many of these prayers commemorate and celebrate wrath and vengeance. What is needed is not ingenious exegetical rationalization of ancient texts, but the kind of transformation into a work of piety and art that is provided here.Addressed are the needs of a world seeking to counter individual and societal injustices by a global peace born of personal peace through prayer and practice. In short, here is the Book of Psalms recast in the light of the continuing revelation and evolution of the authentic religious spirit of the scriptures.</p><p>Nan C. Merrill is the author of <em>Psalms for Praying: An Invitation to Wholeness</em>, which has sold 50,000 copies and is in a tenth-anniversary edition. Her widely used <em>Meditations and Mandalas: Simple Songs for the Spiritual Life</em> is also published by Continuum. Merrill founded the monthly newsletter Friends of Silence, served with urban parish teams, facilitated retreats, and was engaged in prison ministry for more than thirty years. She passed away in January 2010.<br>"Merrill has reworked the Book of Psalms in a loving, contemplative manner, which betrays none of the original vigor or essence. Rather, in a mode that is fresh and eloquent, Merrill's psalms evoke the deep sense of reverence and soul-stirring dialogue with the divine that is often eclipsed by the fear of divine wrath in the original. Highly recommended."&#x2014;Library Journal<br><br>"Merrill allows the Psalms to be something new, fresh, contemporary, and yet still themselves."-Walter Wink<br><br>"In Nan Merrill's re-visioned Psalms, familiar words, rhythms, and conventional meanings provide new insights and intuitions for our times."-Meinrad Craighead<br><br>"The very liveliness of the Psalms causes us to want to say them in our own language. Nan Merrill has done this marvelously, and I'm grateful for this labor of integration and love."-Madeleine L'Engle<br><br>"...[an] excellent companion for morning and evening prayer...[Merrill] has retained the vigor, eloquence, and personal relationship with the Divine that is found in the Old Testament songs, while at the same time adding new insights.

Kennedy Jr. may have been American royalty, but to RoseMarie Terenzio he was an entitled nuisance&#x2014;and she wasn&#x2019;t afraid to let him know it. RoseMarie was his personal assistant, his publicist, and one of his closest confidantes during the last five years of his life. In this, her first memoir, she bravely recounts her own <i>Fairy Tale Interrupted</i>, describing the unlikely friendship between a blue-collar girl from the Bronx and John F. Kennedy Jr. <br><br>Funny, moving, and fresh, her memoir is a unique account by the woman who was with him through dating, politics, the paparazzi, and his marriage to Carolyn Bessette. Her street smarts, paired with her loyalty, candor, and relentless work ethic, made her the trusted insider to America&#x2019;s most famous man. <br><br>After John and Carolyn&#x2019;s tragic, untimely deaths on July 16, 1999, RoseMarie&#x2019;s whole world came crashing down around her, along with her hopes for the future. Only now does she feel she can tell her story in a book that is at once a moving tribute and a very real picture of her friend and employer. <br><br>Many books have sought to capture John F. Kennedy Jr.&#x2019;s life. None has been as intimate or as honest as <i>Fairy Tale Interrupted</i>, a true portrait of the man behind the icon&#x2014;patient, protective, surprisingly goofy, occasionally thoughtless and self-involved, yet capable of extraordinary generosity and kindness. She reveals what John really had in mind for his political future, how he handled media attention, and the reality of life behind the scenes at <i>George </i>magazine. She also shares how she dealt with the ultra-secretive planning of John and Carolyn&#x2019;s wedding on Cumberland Island&#x2014;and the heartbreak of their deaths. <br><br><i>Fairy Tale Interrupted </i>is a deeply loving story and a fascinating adventure, filled with warmth, humor, insight, and five years&#x2019; worth of unforgettable memories.</p><p><b>RoseMarie Terenzio</b> was born in the Bronx and served as personal assistant, publicist, and confidante&nbsp;to John F. Kennedy, Jr.Fairy Tale Interrupted CHAPTER<br>1<p></p> <br>Two types of people exist in this world: those who are obsessed with the Kennedys and those who aren&#x2019;t. My big Italian family from the Bronx sat squarely in the latter camp. My dad, a staunch Republican, had no patience for the family synonymous with the Democratic Party. And my mom was too busy to care about politics on any side of the aisle at all.<br> <br>Obviously, I understood why it created a major stir when John F. Kennedy Jr. first started calling the offices of the Manhattan public relations firm where I worked, PR/NY, but it didn&#x2019;t give me the same thrill as it did Liz, the office manager, and Tricia, the receptionist, who would giggle and exchange meaningful glances whenever he was on the line. To me John was just a political type; I would have been more interested in meeting his celebrity girlfriend Daryl Hannah.<br> <br>It was funny to see Liz and Tricia get excited about anything. The two pretty hipsters shared a blas� attitude toward most aspects of life, including work. But I saw a hint of triumph on the face of whoever got to shout &#x201c;John&#x2019;s on the phone&#x201d; to Michael Berman, cofounder of the firm and the man who gave me the best job I&#x2019;d ever had.<br> <br>Michael started PR/NY after convincing his partner, Will Steere&#x2014;whom he met while both were at the big international PR firm Burson-Marsteller&#x2014;to take a chunk of Burson&#x2019;s business and go out on their own. During my interview in the office, decorated with that brand of sleek minimalism that makes you feel fat and poor, I thought, I&#x2019;m definitely not sophisticated enough for this. But Michael was able to get past my outer-borough accent&#x2014;and my outfit, a red pleated skirt and black-and-white polka-dot blouse that made me look as if someone threw me into a sales rack at Strawberry, spun me around, and set me loose.<br> <br>Working at PR/NY was so different from my last job as a junior-level publicist at a midtown PR company that mainly worked with book publishers, where our offices were small and dingy and the big perk was getting to charge ten dollars a week at the local deli. Will and Michael, meanwhile, were young, rich, and good-looking.<br> <br>Michael, in his jeans, nice shirts, and ever-present tan, ate at Nobu, ran with a celebrity crowd, and dated a well-known interior decorator. Michael could talk to anyone about anything, and he drove the business aspect of PR/NY because he was great at strategy. I worked harder than anyone else in the office to prove to him that I belonged there, that he hadn&#x2019;t made a mistake in taking a chance on me. If Will needed me to run an errand, I was on it. When Michael told me to revise a press release twenty times, I did it without attitude.<br> <br>So when JFK Jr. called the office, to me it was no different from Christopher Reeve or any other celebrity calling for Michael. Other than enjoying watching Liz and Tricia get silly at the sound of his voice, I didn&#x2019;t give him much thought until the day he unexpectedly arrived at PR/NY.<br> <br>Without knowing who was waiting, I buzzed him in, as I always did when someone rang the bell, and punched in the code to open the door. But as I tugged on the handle, he was pulling on the other side, so neither of us could open it. We both released the door, and I reentered the code, then stood back and waited for the person to open the door. Nothing. Oh God, I thought. This isn&#x2019;t that complicated. I punched in the code one more time and pulled, just as he decided to pull yet again.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have to let go of the knob,&#x201d; I said, getting more frustrated.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; came the muted reply.<br> <br>Once again I entered the code and was finally able to open the door, discovering to my horror that I had just snapped at John F. Kennedy Jr.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; he said casually.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was much better looking in person than in any photograph of him I&#x2019;d ever seen&#x2014;and he didn&#x2019;t exactly photograph poorly. Wearing a court-jester-type knit hat, John was accompanied by a large, drooling German shepherd that looked sad and not too friendly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is Michael here?&#x201d; John asked. Although I felt like dying, I pulled myself together and walked John inside. The previous summer, John had left the assistant district attorney position he&#x2019;d held for four years, and he first started coming into the PR/NY office about once a week, and then every other day, sometimes more. By the spring of 1994, it was as if he and his slightly demented rescue dog, Sam, worked at PR/NY&#x2014;only none of the staff, except for Michael, knew what he was doing there. Even Will had no idea. But you didn&#x2019;t ask Michael anything, even if you co-owned the company. Discretion was his stock-in-trade.<br> <br>Will was a dyed-in-the-wool Republican raised in the wealthy Connecticut town of Darien, and every day he wore a perfect suit and a different Herm�s tie, which stood out against the low-key vibe in the office. One of my first days on the job, I asked him if he had an important client meeting. He looked at me like he didn&#x2019;t understand the question, as if that were the only proper way to dress.<br> <br>Will seemed to feel it was his political duty to get a rise out of John, and he loved to greet John with a condescending &#x201c;Hey, Junior!&#x201d; anytime he walked in the door. John refused to take the bait, and instead nodded hello and headed into the conference room with Michael.<br> <br>Because Michael and John were both on the board of Naked Angels&#x2014;a nonprofit theater company in New York supported by celebrities such as Marisa Tomei and Sarah Jessica Parker&#x2014;Liz, Tricia, and I decided the most obvious explanation for their meetings was that they were planning a fund-raiser. But their conversations often became heated; we&#x2019;d see John gesticulating wildly, water bottle in hand, through the slightly open door. And they were always careful to collect the papers spread across the big wooden table before they left the conference room. I was as curious as the next person but figured John was none of my business. That is, until he made himself my business.<br> <br>A few months after John had become a regular at the office, I came into work one morning really hurting. The night before, I&#x2019;d made the mistake of drinking free cocktails at a launch party for a start-up company that delivered anything&#x2014;movies, condoms, ice cream&#x2014;to your apartment day or night. As usual, Frank was along for the ride.<br> <br>I met Frank Giordano, my soul mate, in college, where it was love at first sight. I was walking out of the cafeteria when I spotted a gorgeous guy&#x2014;six foot two, thick hair, dark-brown eyes&#x2014;wearing all white and propped against a yellow Riviera. Frank knew the effect his stunning appearance had on people and often used it, almost comically, to his advantage. With him, nothing was off-limits.<br> <br>We connected instantly, and from that moment on, we were completely inseparable. We did everything together, except have sex. I had never met anyone like him: gorgeous, charismatic, a sweet soul. Hardly ever in a bad mood, Frank was always on a mission to make sure everyone around him was having a good time. After college, I moved with Frank into his mother&#x2019;s home, a gigantic house in Bronxville, New York, until I got the call every New Yorker dreams about, one asking if I&#x2019;d be interested in a rent-stabilized apartment. Frank convinced me to take the place (he wasn&#x2019;t only my best friend and confidant but also my real estate broker) even though it was the most vile, dank, dark three hundred square feet of grime I had ever seen. He promised he would transform the place for me, and he did, stripping and bleaching the floors and repainting. By the time I moved in, the walls were a crisp white and the wood floor felt smooth beneath my feet. There was a little kitchen, a built-in bookcase, a bed, and a bathroom&#x2014;all for me.<br> <br>I had no idea what to do with all this privacy. Growing up in a two-story house on Garfield Street crammed with my mom, dad, great-grandmother, grandma, older sisters Anita, Andrea, and Amy, and two dogs, I wasn&#x2019;t used to alone time. Someone was always in the bathroom, on the couch, or in front of the fridge. Outside wasn&#x2019;t much better, with neighbors hanging out their windows and screaming at one another.<br> <br>But Frank didn&#x2019;t give me a chance to feel lonely. As soon as the apartment was ready, he called all our friends and told them to come over to my new place. I cranked the stereo that Michael and Will had bought me as a housewarming gift and poured everyone drinks before we headed out for a night of dancing at Rouge. When we called it quits around 4:00 a.m., I didn&#x2019;t have to wait for a train at Grand Central or have Frank drive me home. We just hopped in a cab and within minutes were in my new apartment. As far as I was concerned, I had arrived.<br> <br>Frank, always my first call in the morning and last call at night, loved my new life even more than I did. He came as my date to many events, like the launch party for the Manhattan delivery service, where we drank several Speedy Deliveries, the party&#x2019;s signature cocktail, and ended up at a gay bar drinking margaritas.<br> <br>After mixing way too much booze, the next morning I tried in vain to settle my queasy stomach and pounding head with a large coffee from the cart outside the office building. Wearing a pair of extra-large sunglasses, I could smell the alcohol wafting from my pores. The worst part: it was only Monday. (Frank and I loved going out on Sunday nights, because that&#x2019;s when people who lived in the city went out.) I couldn&#x2019;t imagine getting through the morning, let alone the week.<br> <br>All I wanted to do was get into the cozy confines of my office and hide out for the rest of the day. My love affair with my office had started the minute I arrived at PR/NY. The view was of the building&#x2019;s air shaft, but its location at the back of the building gave it a snug quality, where a girl could feel safe calling her friends to bitch about bad dates, have a good cry when she lost a client or, like this morning, nurse a particularly bruising hangover.<br> <br>As I passed through reception, the light streaming in the windows and bouncing off the white walls felt downright debilitating. Making a beeline for my office, I kept my sunglasses on and held on to my coffee as if it were a life raft. I relaxed a bit at the thought of momentarily resting my head on my desk, and opened the door to my cozy little office.<br> <br>What the . . . ?<br> <br>John and a man I didn&#x2019;t recognize were piling my possessions into a cardboard moving box. Adrenaline surged through my body, instantly curing my hangover. No longer weary or nauseous, I was mad&#x2014;and confused.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, hey&#x2014;&#x201d; John said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; I said, cutting him off. &#x201c;What are you doing? And who are you?&#x201d; I pointed at the handsome, silver-haired man in jeans and a fitted T-shirt who was wielding an industrial vacuum cleaner like a pro.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is Effie. He works for me and my family, helping with&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why is he touching my stuff?&#x201d;<br> <br>I whipped off my sunglasses and got into a staring match with Effie.<br> <br>&#x201c;Michael said it was okay for me to move in here,&#x201d; John said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s not okay,&#x201d; I said, spinning around to address him directly. That&#x2019;s when I noticed that not only had they taken down my bulletin board without asking but, in the process, they had ripped one of my most treasured possessions: my Howard Stern head shot. I was crushed.<br> <br>I thought Howard was a god. I admired how he disguised intelligent dialogue about political and social issues as a radio show about farts and strippers. Plus, he made me laugh out loud every single morning. Brilliant, unpretentious, and funny, Howard spoke my language. And anyone who knew me knew I loved him. That&#x2019;s why a colleague from my old job asked his friend, a producer at K-Rock, where Howard did his show, for the irreplaceable head shot, which was now ruined.<br> <br>&#x201c;We can figure this out,&#x201d; John said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Figure this out? Clearly we&#x2019;re not figuring out anything, because you have already packed everything up,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure we can find some sort of solution,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why you need an office, anyway. You don&#x2019;t even have a job.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Michael!&#x201d; John said loudly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe you get away with this everywhere else you go, but not here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Michael!&#x201d;<br> <br>Despite my show of bravado, insecurity welled up inside me at the realization that somebody more important could just walk in and take everything away from me&#x2014;my amazing office, job, and new life in Manhattan. I should have been prepared for this. But I wasn&#x2019;t ready for defeat.<br> <br>Michael shouted for me to get into his office. I left John and his butler boxing up my life and slowly took the ten steps to Michael&#x2019;s office. This was serious. No one ever went in there except to have their review. He was the kind of boss who left you alone. He always had your back, even if a client was unhappy, but he wasn&#x2019;t a micromanager. Instead, he taught by example about what worked and what didn&#x2019;t in PR.<br> <br>What the hell had I been thinking, telling off John F. Kennedy Jr.? Was I insane? Oh well, I thought. My time at PR/NY was fun while it lasted. . . . Starbucks, here I come.<br> <br>I stepped into Michael&#x2019;s immaculate office. He sat behind his sleek desk, with all his perfect pens arranged in an elegant leather cup and a box of wheat grass placed neatly in the corner. His hands were clasped in front of him, and he had a big smirk on his face. He wasn&#x2019;t angry; in fact, he seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the drama. Michael never kissed John&#x2019;s ass and was apparently pleased to see someone following his example.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know, Rose,&#x201d; Michael said, amused. &#x201c;You could be arrested in some states for the way you just spoke to him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why is he taking my office?&#x201d; I whined.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s working with me now. Let&#x2019;s be realistic. You really think I&#x2019;m going to give him the smaller office? You&#x2019;re going to be just fine. What he&#x2019;s doing isn&#x2019;t infringing on your turf. In fact, it has nothing to do with you. So let&#x2019;s get on with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I got the message and left his office, grateful to still have my job. Even though Michael had found my outburst funny, I knew I had to keep my Italian temper in check, since it could get me in a lot of trouble. If I got into a fight with a guy I was dating, I had no problem walking out and leaving him in a restaurant. If I didn&#x2019;t like what somebody was saying to me on the phone, I hung up. During one particularly heated fight with Frank at his apartment, I pulled everything he owned off his bookshelves and dumped a garbage bag of clothes he&#x2019;d left at my house in a heap on the floor. I don&#x2019;t remember exactly what triggered the blowup, but I ransacked his place; it looked like a crime scene when I was done with it.<br> <br>My anger issues were the by-product of a tense childhood in a chaotic environment that was ready to explode at any moment. And the woman holding the lighter to the powder keg was Marion, my Sicilian mother. Talk about an Italian temper.<br> <br>My mother was usually working two jobs, carrying the family&#x2019;s financial load while trying to raise four kids in direct opposition to the way she was raised. My grandparents were not exactly stellar parents, and when they split up, my mother was bounced around like the kid no one wanted. She was determined to do a better job with her kids, and that was a huge amount of pressure. My sisters, Anita, Andrea, and Amy, are older than me by seventeen, ten, and four years, respectively; they helped raise me and were always much better at dealing with our explosive household than I was.<br> <br>When...</p><h2>You Are Special (Gift Edition): A Story for Everyone (Max Lucado&#39;s Wemmicks)</h2><p><p>Every now and then there is a story that touches the hearts of all who hear it.

Despite enduring hardships we can barely imagine today, Facey always saw his life as a "fortunate" one. A true classic of Australian literature, his simply written autobiography is an inspiration.

He was looked after by his grandmother until he was eight years old, when he went out to work. His many jobs included droving, hammering spikes on the railway line from Merredin to Wickepin and boxing in a travelling troupe. He was in the Eleventh Battalion at the Gallipoli landing; after the war, he became a farmer under the Soldier Settlement Scheme but was forced off the land during the Depression. He joined the tramways and was active in the Tramways Union. Facey, who had no formal education, taught himself to read and write. He made the first notes of his life soon after World War I, and filled notebooks with his accounts of his experiences.

Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>E. B. Sledge was born in Mobile, Alabama. In late 1943 he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps, and was then sent to the Pacific where he fought at Peleliu and Okinawa. After returning from the war he immediately began working on a book based on the notes he had taken while posted in the Pacific theatre, which became With the Old Breed. Sledge joined the biology faculty of Alabama College, where he taught until his retirement. Sledge died on March 3rd, 2001.<i>Chapter One<br>Making of a Marine<br></i><br>I enlisted in the Marine Corps on 3 December 1942 at Marion, Alabama. At the time I was a freshman at Marion<br>Military Institute. My parents and brother Edward had urged<br>me to stay in college as long as possible in order to qualify for<br>a commission in some technical branch of the U.S. Army.<br>But, prompted by a deep feeling of uneasiness that the war<br>might end before I could get overseas into combat, I wanted<br>to enlist in the Marine Corps as soon as possible. Ed, a<br>Citadel graduate and a second lieutenant in the army, suggested<br>life would be more beautiful for me as an officer.<br><br>Mother and Father were mildly distraught at the thought of<br>me in the Marines as an enlisted man&#x2013;that is, &#x201c;cannon fodder.&#x201d;<br>So when a Marine recruiting team came to Marion Institute,<br>I compromised and signed up for one of the Corps&#x2019; new<br>officer training programs. It was called V-12.<br><br>The recruiting sergeant wore dress blue trousers, a khaki<br>shirt, necktie, and white barracks hat. His shoes had a shine<br>the likes of which I&#x2019;d never seen. He asked me lots of questions<br>and filled out numerous official papers. When he asked,<br>&#x201c;Any scars, birthmarks, or other unusual features?&#x201d; I described<br>an inch-long scar on my right knee. I asked why such<br>a question. He replied, &#x201c;So they can identify you on some Pacific<br>beach after the Japs blast off your dog tags.&#x201d; This was<br>my introduction to the stark realism that characterized the<br>Marine Corps I later came to know.<br><br>The college year ended the last week of May 1943. I had<br>the month of June at home in Mobile before I had to report 1<br>July for duty at Georgia Tech in Atlanta.<br><br>I enjoyed the train trip from Mobile to Atlanta because the<br>train had a steam engine. The smoke smelled good, and the<br>whistle added a plaintive note reminiscent of an unhurried<br>life. The porters were impressed and most solicitous when I<br>told them, with no little pride, that I was on my way to becoming<br>a Marine. My official Marine Corps meal ticket got me a<br>large, delicious shrimp salad in the dining car and the admiring<br>glances of the steward in attendance.<br><br>On my arrival in Atlanta, a taxi deposited me at Georgia<br>Tech, where the 180-man Marine detachment lived in Harrison<br>Dormitory. Recruits were scheduled to attend classes<br>year round (in my case, about two years), graduate, and then<br>go to the Marine base at Quantico, Virginia, for officers&#x2019;<br>training.<br><br>A Marine regular, Capt. Donald Payzant, was in charge.<br>He had served with the 1st Marine Division on Guadalcanal.<br>Seeming to glory in his duty and his job as our commander,<br>he loved the Corps and was salty and full of swagger. Looking<br>back, I realize now that he had survived the meat grinder<br>of combat and was simply glad to be in one piece with the<br>good fortune of being stationed at a peaceful college campus.<br>Life at Georgia Tech was easy and comfortable. In short,<br>we didn&#x2019;t know there was a war going on. Most of the college<br>courses were dull and uninspiring. Many of the professors<br>openly resented our presence. It was all but impossible to<br>concentrate on academics. Most of us felt we had joined the<br>Marines to fight, but here we were college boys again. The<br>situation was more than many of us could stand. At the end of<br>the first semester, ninety of us&#x2013;half of the detachment&#x2013;<br>flunked out of school so we could go into the Corps as enlisted<br>men.<br><br>When the navy officer in charge of academic affairs called<br>me in to question me about my poor academic performance, I<br>told him I hadn&#x2019;t joined the Marine Corps to sit out the war in<br>college. He was sympathetic to the point of being fatherly<br>and said he would feel the same way if he were in my place.<br>Captain Payzant gave the ninety of us a pep talk in front of<br>the dormitory the morning we were to board the train for boot<br>camp at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, California.<br>He told us we were the best men and the best Marines in<br>the detachment. He said he admired our spirit for wanting to<br>get into the war. I think he was sincere.<br><br>After the pep talk, buses took us to the railway station. We<br>sang and cheered the whole way. We were on our way to war<br>at last. If we had only known what lay ahead of us!<br>Approximately two and a half years later, I came back<br>through the Atlanta railway station on my way home. Shortly<br>after I stepped off the car for a stroll, a young army infantryman<br>walked up to me and shook hands. He said he had noticed<br>my 1st Marine Division patch and the campaign ribbons<br>on my chest and wondered if I had fought at Peleliu. When I<br>said I had, he told me he just wanted to express his undying<br>admiration for men of the 1st Marine Division.<br><br>He had fought with the 81st Infantry Division (Wildcats),<br>which had come in to help us at Peleliu.* He was a machine<br>gunner, had been hit by Japanese fire on Bloody Nose Ridge,<br>and was abandoned by his army comrades. He knew he<br>would either die of his wounds or be cut up by the Japanese<br>when darkness fell. Risking their lives, some Marines had<br>moved in and carried him to safety. The soldier said he was so<br>impressed by the bravery, efficiency, and esprit of the<br>Marines he saw on Peleliu that he swore to thank every veteran<br>of the 1st Marine Division he ever ran across.<br>The &#x201c;Dago people&#x201d;&#x2013;as those of us bound for San Diego<br>were called&#x2013;boarded a troop train in a big railroad terminal<br>in Atlanta. Everyone was in high spirits, as though we were<br>headed for a picnic instead of boot camp&#x2013;and a war. The trip<br>across the country took several days and was uneventful but<br>interesting. Most of us had never been west, and we enjoyed<br>the scenery. The monotony of the trip was broken with card<br>games, playing jokes on each other, and waving, yelling, and<br>whistling at any and all women visible. We ate some meals in<br>dining cars on the train; but at certain places the train pulled<br>onto a siding, and we ate in the restaurant in the railroad terminal.<br>Nearly all of the rail traffic we passed was military. We saw<br>long trains composed almost entirely of flatcars loaded with<br>tanks, halftracks, artillery pieces, trucks, and other military<br>equipment. Many troop trains passed us going both ways.<br>Most of them carried army troops. This rail traffic impressed<br>on us the enormousness of the nation&#x2019;s war effort.<br><br>*Together with the 1st Marine Division, the U.S. Army&#x2019;s 81st Infantry Division<br>comprised the III Amphibious Corps commanded by Maj. Gen. Roy S.<br>Geiger, USMC. For the Palau operation, the 1st Marine Division assaulted<br>Peleliu on 15 September 1944 while the 81st Division took Angaur Island<br>and provided a regiment as corps reserve. The 81st Division relieved the 1st<br>Marine Division on Peleliu on 20 October and secured the island on 27 November.<br><br>We arrived in San Diego early one morning. Collecting our<br>gear, we fell into ranks outside our cars as a first sergeant<br>came along and told the NCOs on our train which buses to get<br>us aboard. This first sergeant looked old to us teenagers. Like<br>ourselves, he was dressed in a green wool Marine uniform,<br>but he had campaign ribbons on his chest. He also wore the<br>green French <i>fourrag�re </i>on his left shoulder. (Later, as a<br>member of the 5th Marine Regiment, I would wear the<br>braided cord around my left arm with pride.) But this man<br>sported, in addition, two single loops outside his arm. That<br>meant he had served with a regiment (either the 5th or 6th<br>Marines) that had received the award from France for distinguished<br>combat service in World War I.<br><br>The sergeant made a few brief remarks to us about the<br>tough training we faced. He seemed friendly and compassionate,<br>almost fatherly. His manner threw us into a false<br>sense of well-being and left us totally unprepared for the<br>shock that awaited us when we got off those buses.<br><br>&#x201c;Fall out, and board your assigned buses!&#x201d; ordered the first<br>sergeant.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, you people. Get aboard them buses!&#x201d; the NCOs<br>yelled. They seemed to have become more authoritarian as<br>we approached San Diego.<br><br>After a ride of only a few miles, the buses rolled to a stop in<br>the big Marine Corps Recruit Depot&#x2013;boot camp. As I<br>looked anxiously out the window, I saw many platoons of recruits<br>marching along the streets. Each drill instructor (DI)<br>bellowed his highly individual cadence. The recruits looked<br>as rigid as sardines in a can. I grew nervous at seeing how<br>serious&#x2013;or rather, scared&#x2013;they seemed.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, you people, off them damned buses!&#x201d;<br><br>We scrambled out, lined up with men from the other buses,<br>and were counted off into groups of about sixty. Several<br>trucks rolled by carrying work parties of men still in boot<br>camp or who had finished recently. All looked at us with<br>knowing grins and jeered, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be sorreee.&#x201d; This was the<br>standard, unofficial greeting extended to all recruits.<br><br>Shortly after we debused, a corporal walked over to my<br>group. He yelled, &#x201c;Patoon, teehut. Right hace, forwart huah.<br>Double time, huah.&#x201d;<br><br>He ran us up and down the streets for what seemed hours<br>and finally to a double line of huts that would house us for a<br>time. We were breathless. He didn&#x2019;t even seem to be breathing<br>hard.<br><br>&#x201c;Patoon halt, right hace!&#x201d; He put his hands on his hips and<br>looked us over contemptuously. &#x201c;You people are stupid,&#x201d; he<br>bellowed. From then on he tried to prove it every moment of<br>every day. &#x201c;My name is Corporal Doherty. I&#x2019;m your drill instructor.<br>This is Platoon 984. If any of you idiots think you<br>don&#x2019;t need to follow my orders, just step right out here and I&#x2019;ll<br>beat your ass right now. Your soul may belong to Jesus, but<br>your ass belongs to the Marines. You people are <i>recruits.<br></i>You&#x2019; re <i>not </i>Marines. You may not have what it takes to be<br>Marines.&#x201d;<br><br>No one dared move, hardly even to breathe. We were all<br>humbled, because there was no doubt the DI meant exactly<br>what he said.<br><br>Corporal Doherty wasn&#x2019;t a large man by any standard. He<br>stood about five feet ten inches, probably weighed around<br>160 pounds, and was muscular with a protruding chest and<br>flat stomach. He had thin lips, a ruddy complexion, and was<br>probably as Irish as his name. From his accent I judged him to<br>be a New Englander, maybe from Boston. His eyes were the<br>coldest, meanest green I ever saw. He glared at us like a wolf<br>whose first and foremost desire was to tear us limb from limb.<br>He gave me the impression that the only reason he didn&#x2019;t do<br>so was that the Marine Corps wanted to use us for cannon<br>fodder to absorb Japanese bullets and shrapnel so genuine<br>Marines could be spared to capture Japanese positions.<br>That Corporal Doherty was tough and hard as nails none of<br>us ever doubted. Most Marines recall how loudly their DIs<br>yelled at them, but Doherty didn&#x2019;t yell very loudly. Instead he<br>shouted in an icy, menacing manner that sent cold chills<br>through us. We believed that if he didn&#x2019;t scare us to death, the<br>Japs couldn&#x2019;t kill us. He was always immaculate, and his uniform<br>fitted him as if the finest tailor had made it for him. His<br>posture was erect, and his bearing reflected military precision.<br>The public pictures a DI wearing sergeant stripes. Doherty<br>commanded our respect and put such fear into us that he<br>couldn&#x2019;t have been more effective if he had had the six stripes<br>of a first sergeant instead of the two of a corporal. One fact<br>emerged immediately with stark clarity: this man would be<br>the master of our fates in the weeks to come.<br><br>Doherty rarely drilled us on the main parade ground, but<br>marched or double-timed us to an area near the beach of San<br>Diego Bay. There the deep, soft sand made walking exhausting,<br>just what he wanted. For hours on end, for days on end,<br>we drilled back and forth across the soft sand. My legs ached<br>terribly for the first few days, as did those of everyone else in<br>the platoon. I found that when I concentrated on a fold of the<br>collar or cap of the man in front of me or tried to count the<br>ships in the bay, my muscles didn&#x2019;t ache as badly. To drop out<br>of ranks because of tired legs was unthinkable. The standard<br>remedy for such shirking was to &#x201c;double-time in place to get<br>the legs in shape&#x201d;&#x2013;before being humiliated and berated in<br>front of the whole platoon by the DI. I preferred the pain to<br>the remedy.<br><br>Before heading back to the hut area at the end of each drill<br>session, Doherty would halt us, ask a man for his rifle, and<br>tell us he would demonstrate the proper technique for holding<br>the rifle while creeping and crawling. First, though, he would<br>place the butt of the rifle on the sand, release the weapon, and<br>let it drop, saying that anyone who did that would have a<br>miserable day of it. With so many men in the platoon, it was<br>uncanny how often he asked to use my rifle in this demonstration. Then, after demonstrating how to cradle the rifle, he ordered<br>us to creep and crawl. Naturally, the men in front<br>kicked sand onto the rifle of the one behind him. With this<br>and several other techniques, the DI made it necessary for us<br>to clean our rifles several times each day. But we learned<br>quickly and well an old Marine Corps truism, &#x201c;The rifle is a<br>Marine&#x2019;s best friend.&#x201d; We always treated it as just that.<br><br>During the first few days, Doherty once asked one of the<br>recruits a question about his rifle. In answering, the hapless<br>recruit referred to his rifle as &#x201c;my gun.&#x201d; The DI muttered<br>some instructions to him, and the recruit blushed. He began<br>trotting up and down in front of the huts holding his rifle in<br>one hand and his penis in the other, chanting, &#x201c;This is my rifle,&#x201d;<br>as he held up his M1, &#x201c;and this is my gun,&#x201d; as he moved<br>his other arm. &#x201c;This is for Japs,&#x201d; he again held aloft his M1;<br>&#x201c;and this is for fun,&#x201d; he held up his other arm. Needless to say,<br>none of us ever again used the word &#x201c;gun&#x201d; unless referring to<br>a shotgun, mortar, artillery piece, or naval gun.<br><br>A typical day in boot camp began with reveille at 0400<br>hours. We tumbled out of our sacks in the chilly dark and hurried<br>through shaves, dressing, and chow. The grueling day<br>ended with taps at 2200. At any time between taps and<br>reveille, however, the DI might break us out for rifle inspection,<br>close-order drill, or for a run around the parade ground<br>or over the sand by the bay. This seemingly cruel and senseless<br>harassment stood me in good stead later when I found<br>that war allowed sleep to no man, particularly the infantryman.<br>Combat guaranteed sleep of the permanent type only.<br>We moved to two or three different hut areas during the<br>first few weeks, each time on a moment&#x2019;s notice.

She likes to style her dolls hair, but real hairdressers cut hair too.</p><p></p><h2>The Dead Yard: A Novel</h2><p>In this breathtaking sequel to <i>Dead I Well May Be</i>, which <i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i> called "the most captivating crime novel" of the year, mercenary bad boy Michael Forsythe is forced to infiltrate an Irish terrorist cell on behalf of the FBI, and thus confront murder, mayhem, and the prospect of his own execution. <p> With the same poetic lilt and heart-stopping suspense that made <i>Dead I Well May Be</i> a critical favorite, the saga continues with <i>The Dead Yard</i> -- a thriller in which Michael Forsythe must insinuate himself into the good graces of a band of calculating political terrorists. </p><p> As the novel opens, he's on vacation in Spain, but when a soccer riot between Irish and English fans escalates out of control, Michael is suddenly arrested and thrown into a Spanish prison. Enter Samantha, a British intelligence agent as cunning as she is voluptuous. She makes Michael an offer he cannot refuse: instead of being extradited to Mexico to serve time for a prison break, he can help her by infiltrating an IRA sleeper cell in the United States, and she'll see to it that the Spaniards and Mexicans forget all about him. Filled with apprehension about the dangers of the assignment, Michael reluctantly agrees. Within hours he is flown to New York City and thrust into the nightmare world of men known for their distinctive brands of torture and revenge. Michael crosses and double-crosses key players, escapes his own lies by a hairsbreadth, loses his only ally, and falls for the daughter of his enemy -- a most inadvisable development. </p><p> Boasting spot-on dialogue, crackling wit, and one of the most memorable heroes in all of crime fiction, Adrian McKinty's dazzling new novel confirms his reputation as a brilliant storyteller and writer on the rise.</p></p><p><b>Adrian McKinty</b> was born and grew up in Carrickfergus, Northern Ireland, when terrorism in Ulster was at its height. Educated at Oxford University, he then immigrated to New York City, where he lived in Harlem for five years, working in bars and on construction crews, as well as a stint as a bookseller. He is the author of <i>Hidden River</i> and <i>Dead I Well May Be</i>, which was short-listed for the Crime Writers' Association Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award. He lives in Denver, Colorado.<p> <b>Chapter 1: A Riot on Tenerife</b> </p><p> Dawn over the turquoise shore of Africa and here, under the fractured light of a streetlamp, brought to earth like some hurricaned palm, I woke before the supine ocean amidst a sea of glass and upturned bus stands and the wreck of cars and looted stores. </p><p> The streets of Playa de las Americas were flowing with beer and black sewage and blood. Smoke hung above the seashore and the smell was of desolation, decay, the burning of tires and fuel oil. The noise of birds, diesel engines, a dirgelike siren, a helicopter, voices in Spanish over a loudspeaker -- all of it more than enough hint of the breakdown in the fragile rules of the social contract. </p><p> I was sitting up and adjusting to the light and the growing heat when a kid hustled me under cover and the riot began again. </p><p> Five hundred British football hooligans, three hundred and fifty Irish fans, all of them on this island at the same time for a "friendly" match between Dublin's Shamrock Rovers and London's Millwall. </p><p> A riot. </p><p> I wouldn't say I'd been expecting that but I wouldn't say I was that goddamn surprised either. </p><p> Some people go through their lives like a mouse moving through a wheat field. They're good citizens, they pay their taxes, they contribute to society, they have kids and the kids turn them into responsible adults. They create no stir, cause no fuss, leave no trace. When they're gone people speak well of them, sigh, shrug their shoulders, and shed a tear. They avoid chaos and it avoids them. </p><p> Perhaps most people are like this. </p><p> But not me. </p><p> You'd notice me in the wheat field. You'd notice me because the field would be on fire or the farmer would be running after me with a gun. </p><p> The Bible says that man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward. Well, trouble followed me like sharks trailing a slave ship. Even when I tried to get away it was there swirling in a vortex around me. </p><p> Even when I tried to get away. Spain. Tenerife, to be exact, the largest of the Canary Islands off the coast of Morocco. It's a hell of a long flight from Chicago but the FBI won't let me go near Florida or the Caribbean. Seamus Duffy, the head of the Irish mob in New York City, has had a contract out on me for five years for killing his underboss Darkey White and testifying against Darkey's crew. </p><p> With that in mind you can't be too careful about where you take your vacation. So O'Hare, JFK, and seven hours to Tenerife for a wee bit of R &amp; R and of course this is what bloody happens. </p><p> "Brian, are you all right?" the English kid asked. Pale skin, sunburned, wearing a Millwall shirt and white jeans. </p><p> I stared at him. My name had been Brian O'Nolan since I'd moved to Chicago in January. It still didn't seem right. </p><p> "I'm ok," I said. "I must have fallen asleep. What the hell is happening?" </p><p> "The riot's starting up again. Those Irish bastards have all gotten ball bearings from somewhere." </p><p> I gave him a look. </p><p> One of those looks. </p><p> My speciality. </p><p> "Oh, by Irish bastards, I meant, uh, I meant no offense by the way," he stammered. </p><p> I didn't say anything. I almost felt more American now than Irish. I ducked as stones and ball bearings landed in the shop fronts. Pieces of dark lava and Molotov cocktails flew back from the English side. </p><p> The London lads were drunk and the Dublin boys had taken off their shirts, looking like ghosts flitting nervously behind the barricades. </p><p> The riot progressed. A shop window caved in under a big rock, a roof collapsed, a car went up in flames. A big English bruiser trundled along a wheely-bin filled with gasoline and halfway down the hill, he burned some scrunched-up newspaper and tossed it after. The bin exploded and he caught fire. He rolled on the ground and the cops grabbed him and dragged him off to a police car. </p><p> Jesus. </p><p> The colors fused: green banana skins, inky smoke, crimson blood, the blue Atlantic and iodine sky merging in the west. Over by the dunes amazed surfers were wondering if the town was on fire, and later it was, as the hotel burned and the surfers and the other noncombatants decided to be long gone. </p><p> At dusk the Spanish police finally got their act together and turned fire hoses on the two sides. The Micks started an out-of-date football chant: "Francisco Franco is a wanker," and the English side trumped that with "What Happened to the Armada?" Singing was general over the lines now and each song was echoed back and as full night fell, everyone got teary-eyed and guilt-ridden and we had a truce, the impromptu leaders meeting up in one of the main squares under a flag of armistice. </p><p> The shadows lengthened and there was a toast. A drink. A parley. And it was agreed then that whatever differences existed between the Irish and the English soccer fans, here, fifteen hundred miles from the British Isles, the story wasn't terrorism or the Famine or Enniskillen or Bloody Sunday. It was August 1997 now, there was a new British prime minister, and a new IRA cease-fire brewing that extended even unto football hooligans. Aye, we could see that out here with our fresh perspective. Here in Tenerife under the black sky of Creation, where Columbus set out to enslave half the world, where Darwin came on the Beagle, where Nelson lost his arm, and where they still made the same dark Canary drunk by Falstaff and Sir Toby Belch. Where we were all away from gloomy Albion and we could accept a new vision of a new Earth with sunshine and cheap food and Swedish girls and where we could see the folly of doing evil unto one's brother. The drunken leaders deciding that harmony would reign forever between kinfolk and that the riot between the Brits and Paddies was over; and from now on we would concentrate on the real enemies: German tourists and the Spanish police. </p><p> So began the second phase. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> This time, though, I wanted no part of it, especially when I saw the big NATO war helicopters landing beyond the cliffs and out of them pouring scores of paramilitary cops from Madrid -- tough bastards who came with machine pistols and gas and billy clubs that they used up in the Basque country against the ETA guerrillas. Me and the kid, an eejit called Goosey, slipped away from the drunken insurgents under the cover of darkness. We negotiated our way through the abandoned holiday villas and the half-built outlying hotels and the pink-shaded small pensions where a few British expats hid in the dark, having retired to Tenerife to escape the bad weather and (ironically) the growing yob culture of England. </p><p> Goosey, it turned out, was a bit of a mental case from some East London shitehole who wanted us to do a <i>Clockwork Orange</i>-style burglary on some of the pensions, nicking things and hurting people and generally raising a bit of hell, but I would have none of it. They might have shooters, I told Goosey, and Goosey thought this was entirely plausible and got discouraged from the idea. </p><p> Instead up we went into the lava fields and through the mangrove and the palm trees until we'd climbed a thousand feet above the town. We slept in a barn among guano and baked hay and the sleep was the best since the riots had begun two days ago when three Millwall supporters had attacked some guy from Dublin and the peelers had allegedly beaten the near life out of them down at the cop shop. It had grown like a tropical storm, stores being looted and cars set ablaze and the climax came when the local jail had been stormed and the Millwall boys and a team of time-share crooks were let out and one person got himself shot in the shoulder by a peeler. </p><p> The town beneath us five thousand feet and four miles to the west and the paramilitary police taking no prisoners, using dogs, whips, CS gas, and water cannon and this time the rioters were being rounded up like sheep. Fires burned and the helicopters came and went and it was ending now, we could tell. </p><p> "<i>Agua</i>," we asked a herder and he showed us a stream and we followed it another thousand feet up into the hills where, at a stone wall, it formed part of the boundary of a hacienda. We vaulted the wall, got about a quarter of a mile before a man in a suit appeared on a three-wheeled motorbike and asked us what the hell we thought we were doing. And not about to let Goosey do the talking I explained that we were innocent kids fleeing a riot down in Playa de las Americas. The man adjusted his sunglasses and said something into a walkie-talkie. He escorted us up to the hacienda, where a beautiful woman in her forties sat us down at an oak table under pine beams and gave us water and brandy. </p><p> "<i>Muchas gracias, bella se�orita</i>," I said and the woman laughed and muttered something to the man in sunglasses and he went back outside and then she said to me in English that she was married and was no se�orita anymore and not even beautiful either. To which I sincerely disagreed and she laughed again and asked me what exactly had been going on at the beach and I told her, leaving out our part in the proceedings. </p><p> She fed us and gave us directions to the town of Guia de Isora. </p><p> By the afternoon our supplies were gone and we were lost in a region that had an uncanny similarity to the place the NASA robots keep landing on the planet Mars. Rocks, stones, thin red soil. It grew unbearably hot. Goosey started swaying a bit, and all around us desert, black lava, and the baking sun. We sat under a rock and decided to move again at night. The sun set, it grew cold, above us we saw what God had made when he was getting things ready for the Earth. A million stars. A billion. Blue and red and Doppler-shifted ultraviolet. </p><p> I thought for a minute that we were toast, but we fell in the backbone of the night and its spell guided us safely through the wilderness. The sun rose over the sand hills and in the morning we were at a wire fence surrounding a banana plantation. We broke in and with comedy climbed a tree and gorged ourselves on green fruit. Nature was a civilizing influence and Goosey had given up plans for <i>Clockwork Orange</i> rampages and was no...</p></p><h2>The Savage Detectives</h2><p>First published in Spanish in 1998, The Savage Detectives was immediately hailed as a critical success, wining the Herralde Prize and the Romulo Gallegos Prize.

It was one of the most rugged and trouble-free military rifles developed during early 20th century and served in every one of the British Empire's military actions from India's Northwest Frontier to the colonial wars of the 1950s and 1960s. <p>The SMLE underwent many changes during its years of production in dozens of factories and arsenals in Great Britain, Canada, India, Australia and South Africa. Determining where a particular SMLE was made is often subordinate to attempting to figure out which model and variation of rifle one has. The British developed a very systematic way of accounting for models and design changes but one which can be quite puzzling. Briefly, models are "marks," abbreviated, "Mk." Major changes to that model, or mark, are listed by Roman numerals, i.e., SMLE Mk I or Mk III. Minor changes to that model are listed by the addition on an asterisk, "*". In the mid-1930s, a new system of model designation was introduced. The SMLE Mk III became the "No. 1 (but of course, the rifles, all made before the change continued to carry the original designation stamped into the receiver). After India achieved Independence in 1947, they continued to follow the British marking system, but with codes and specific to their needs. </p><p>The next step is determining which factory made the rifle's receiver (after seventy some years of use there are very few rifles without one or more replacement parts). The factory name or abbreviation was often stamped on the receiver but may have been obscured by use. Other markings and indicators though are always present if you know what to look for. The same holds true for virtually every part. And since parts for the SMLE are in plentiful supply, returning a rifle to its original factory condition can almost always be accomplished. </p><p>In addition to manufacturer's markings, British armorers and "storekeepers" (ordnance types) stamped the SMLE with a profusion of markings that when translated can often provide a pretty thorough history of the rifle's use, right down to the units in which it served. And finally, while the SMLE is a rugged battle rifle, well tested over the years, parts still do break. It is essential to know the model and variation of your rifle in order to replace the part correctly.</p></p><p>Charles Stratton has done an admirable job in The Enfield Rifle, Vol. 1, The SMLE (No.1) Mk I and Mk III, of organizing information about a complicated subject. The very clear and understandable text plus concise line drawings and easy-to-understand charts make it possible for the collector and shooter to know the SMLE rifle thoroughly. Charles Stratton's also provides a thorough history of the development of the SMLE and decipher's the often mysterious inspection, store keeper's and unit identification markings found on complete rifles, but also on each individual part. Charts, text, line drawings and photos show the collector and arms historian how to determine the origin and age of each part as well as the overall rifle. He decodes all the markings and relates then to specific arsenals. <p>Collectors and shooters will find all the information needed to understand the origins of this fine military rifle, determine its duty stations in many instances and assemble, disassemble (no mean trick) and maintain it in this book.</p></p><h2>The Chalice of Life: Reflections on the Significant Stages in Life</h2><p>This book is a collection of five addresses that F. W. Boreham delivered on some major stages of life, and this is accompanied by two further essays in which the author develops the theme of life's milestones. <p>Throughout these pages one feels the sheer exuberance that Boreham had for life. He possesses a sense of wonder about the newness of each day. </p><p>His approach is to greet each day with expectancy and to make the momentous decisions with which life confronts us. F. W. Boreham claimed that the greatest day of a person's life was not their birthday, their wedding anniversary, or the date of their death but, The greatest day in a man's life is the day on which he finds himself overwhelmed and bowed to earth by a sense of the greatness of God (Dr. Geoff Pound). </p><p>Please consider checking out the other titles published by John Broadbanks Publishing.</p><p>A portion of the sale of each Boreham book will go toward the training of pastors and missionaries at Whitley College, a ministry that Boreham supported during his lifetime. The new Second Edition (2012) updates front and back matter.</p></p><p>BOREHAM, FRANK WILLIAM (1871-1959), preacher and writer, was born on March 3, 1871 at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, eldest child of Francis Boreham, solicitor&#39;s clerk, and his wife Fanny Usher. He was educated and was later a pupil-teacher at Grosvenor United School, Tunbridge Wells. In December 1884 he became junior clerk with a local brickworks where, in a locomotive accident, he lost his right foot, necessitating the life-long use of a stick. Late in 1887 he went to work as a clerk in London, becoming increasingly involved in church, debating and writing activities. Although his family was Anglican, he was baptized at Stockwell Old Baptist Church in 1890; he preached from pavement and pulpit and published &#34;Won to Glory&#34; in 1891. He was admitted to Spurgeon&#39;s College, London, in August 1892, serving as a student-minister at Theydon Bois, Essex, where he met Estella Maud Mary Cottee. In 1894 Boreham was called to the Scottish community at Mosgiel near Dunedin in New Zealand, and was inducted on March 17, 1895. Stella, then 18, followed to marry him at Kaiapoi on April 13, 1896. Boreham became president of the Baptist Union of New Zealand in 1902, and published &#34;The Whisper of God and Other Sermons.&#34; He wrote editorials for the Otago Daily Times, contributed to theological journals and, as a keen temperance advocate, participated in liquor polls in 1905 and 1907. In June 1906 Boreham was called to the Baptist Tabernacle, Hobart. He edited the Southern Baptist and later the weekly Australian Baptist and in 1910 became president of the Tasmanian Baptist Union. His &#34;George Augustus Selwyn&#34; was published in 1911. He wrote a biographical series for the Hobart Mercury, which in 40 years covered 2000 persons; in 1912-59 he contributed 2500 editorials to the Mercury and the Melbourne Age. Boreham&#39;s 80 publications, including religious works, homiletic essays and novels, sold over one million copies.Don't overlook this book because of the size, 58 pages plus 12 pages of front matter for a total of 70 pages, which includes a foreword by Geoff Pound. This is the first time that Boreham's essays on reaching the various decades of life have ever been put together. <p>One of the essays, "Life at Fifty," has never been published in a book. I am proud of the content that was assembled by Geoff Pound. </p><p>The names of the other essays are "Life at Thirty," "Life at Forty," "Life at Sixty," "Life at Seventy," "So It's Your Birthday," and "Life's Landmarks." An "About the Cover" section is included in the back of the book. --Michael Dalton</p></p><h2>The Werewolf of Paris</h2><p>In a work that strives to do for werewolves what Stoker&#39;s Dracula did for vampires, Endore&#39;s werewolf, an outcast named Bertrand Caillet, travels round seeking to calm the beast within. An episodic tale, the story wanders through 19th Century France and into hotspots like the Franco-Prussian war. Stunning in its sexual frankness and eerie, fog-enshrouded visions, this novel was decidedly influential for the generations of horror and science fiction authors who came after.</p><p>A Hollywood screenwriter who collaborated on scripts like <i>Mark of the Vampire</i>, as well as receiving an Oscar nomination for <i>The Story of G.I. Joe</i>, <b>Guy Endore</b> also wrote several novels, including <i>Nightmare and King of Paris</i>. A cult favorite of fans of horror, he is best known for <i>The Werewolf of Paris</i>, which occupies a significant position in werewolf literature, much in the same way that <i>Dracula</i> does for vampire literature. Guy Endore died in 1970.&#x201c;First published in 1933, Guy Endore&#x2019;s <em>The Werewolf of Paris</em> may finally be coming into its own. Like those other horror classics, Mary Shelley&#x2019;s <em>Frankenstein</em> and Bram Stoker&#x2019;s <em>Dracula</em>, this notorious novel doesn&#x2019;t just aim for raw head-and-bloody-bones gruesomeness.

But the book delivers an often insightful series of meditations on Jesus' interpersonal style, focusing on what set him apart as a leader. In a nonacademic way, Jones has contributed to an academic tradition of leadership studies that focus on characters from the so-called great books. To my knowledge, Jesus has not been a popular subject for such studies, but the success of the movement with which he is associated makes him a plausible candidate. This book's strength lies in its ability to surprise two very different groups of readers: those put off by a title slanted toward corporate success and those attracted by the title's promise of a step-by-step guide to such success. To the extent that Jones comes from left field to surprise both groups, she practices what she preaches. Along the way, she dispenses practical and pithy advice for anyone (whether CEO or not) who works with other people to get things done. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>Domesday: A Search for the Roots of England</h2><p>Drawing on William the Conqueror&#39;s eleventh-century survey of England the author traces the roots of English culture and history, from first-century Roman occupation to the beginning of the English Renaissance in the fifteenth century</p><p>$24.95. hist Late to reach these shores is one of the best among the popular histories observing the 900th anniversary of Domesday Book, the great survey of English land and people made in 1086 for William the Conqueror.

It means more than the arrival of trendy shops, much-maligned hipsters, and expensive lattes. The very future of American cities as vibrant, equitable spaces hangs in the balance.<br><br>Peter Moskowitz's <i>How to Kill a City</i> takes readers from the kitchen tables of hurting families who can no longer afford their homes to the corporate boardrooms and political backrooms where destructive housing policies are devised. Along the way, Moskowitz uncovers the massive, systemic forces behind gentrification in New Orleans, Detroit, San Francisco, and New York. The deceptively simple question of who can and cannot afford to pay the rent goes to the heart of America's crises of race and inequality. In the fight for economic opportunity and racial justice, nothing could be more important than housing.<br><br>A vigorous, hard-hitting expose, <i>How to Kill a City</i> reveals who holds power in our cities-and how we can get it back<br><br></p><p>Peter Moskowitz is a freelance journalist who has covered a wide variety of issues, from environmental disasters to the vestiges of racist urban planning.

But a hilarious twist ending will have readers realizing there&#x2019;s more to this imaginary friend than meets the eye!<br><br>Another of Polacco&#x2019;s immensely popular younger books, Emma Kate is a wonderfully original story of pretend play and real friendship.</p><p>"I was born in Lansing, Michigan in 1944. Soon after my birth I lived in Williamston, Michigan and then moved onto my grandparents farm in Union City, Michigan.<p>"I lived on the farm with my mom and Grandparents until 1949. That is when my Babushka (my grandmother) died and we prepared to move away from Michigan. I must say that living on that little farm with them was the most magical time of my life...and that my Babushka and other grandparents were some of the most inspirational people in my life.</p><p>"My parents were divorced when I was 3, and both my father and mother moved back into the homes of their parents. I spent the school year with my mother, and the summers with my dad. In both households I was the apple of my grandparents' eyes! I would say that these relationships with my grandparents have most definitely influenced my life and my work. You probably have noticed that in almost every book that I write there is a very young person who is interacting with an elderly person. Personally, I feel that this is the most valuable experience of my life....having the wonder of knowing both children and elderly people.</p><p>"The respect that I learned as a very young person certainly carried over into my life in later years. I have always like hearing stories from these folks. My genuine curiosity for the wonder of living a very long life prepared me to accept the declining years of my own parents.</p><p>"To get back to the farm in Union City...this place was so magical to me that I have never forgotten it! This was the place where I heard such wonderful stories told...this was the place that a real meteor fell into our font yard...that very meteorite is now our family headstone in the graveyard here in Union City.</p><p>"Did I tell you that I now live in Union City? This is after living in Oakland, California for almost 37 years. But, you see, every year I'd come back to Michigan to see my Dad and family.</p><p>"Anyway...</p><p>"In 1949 we left the farm to move, first to Coral Gables, Florida. I lived there with my Mom and my brother, Richard, for almost 3 years. Then we moved to Oakland, California. I remained there for most of my young life on into my adulthood. We lived on Ocean View Drive in the Rockridge District. What I loved the most about this neighborhood is that all of my neighbors came in as many colors, ideas and religions as there are people on the planet. How lucky I was to know so many people that were so different and yet so much alike.</p><p>"It is on Ocean View that I met my best friend, Stewart Grinnell Washington. We are best friends to this day! He has a younger brother, Winston and three sisters; Jackie, Terry and Robin. When I was a student in elementary school I wasn't a very good student. I had a terrible time with reading and math. As a matter of fact, I did not learn how to read until I was almost 14 years old. Can you imagine what it was like to see all my friends do so well in school and I wasn't! I thought I was dumb. I didn't like school because there was this boy that always teased me and made me feel even dumber. When I was fourteen, it was learned that I have a learning disability. It is called dyslexia. I felt trapped in a body that wouldn't do what everybody else could do. That was when one of my hero's, my teacher, found what was wrong with me and got me the help I needed to succeed in school. Of course, now that I am an adult, I realize that being learning disabled does not mean DUMB AT ALL! As a matter of fact, I have learned that being learning disabled only means that I cannot learn the way most of you do. As a matter of fact, most learning disabled children are actually GENIUSES! Once I learned how to read and caught up with the rest of my fellow students, I did very well.</p><p>"I went on to University, majored in Fine Art, then went on to do a graduate degree and even ended up with a Ph.D. in Art History. For a time I restored ancient pieces of art for museums. I eventually became the mother of two children, Steven and Traci, and devoted much of my days to their education and upbringing.</p><p>"I did not start writing children's books until I was 41 years old. Mind you the "art" has always been there for me most of my life. Apparently one of the symptoms of my disability in academics is the ability of draw very, very well. So drawing, painting and sculpture has always been a part of my life even before I started illustrating my books. The books were quite a surprise, really. Mind you, I came from a family of incredible storytellers. My mother's people were from the Ukraine and Russia...my father's people were from Ireland. My extended family,(Stewart's family) were from the bayous of Louisiana...also great story tellers. When you are raised on HEARING stories.....NOT SEEING THEM, you become very good at telling stories yourself. So at the age of 41 I started putting stories that I told down on paper and did drawings to help illustrate them...I guess the rest is history.</p><p>"I have enjoyed a wonderful career of writing books for children . Who could have guessed that little girl that was having such a tough time in school would end up an illustrator and author. Children and adults alike ask me where I get my ideas...I get them from the same place that you do....MY IMAGINATION... I would guess the reason my imagination is so fertile is because I came from storytelling and, WE DID NOT OWN A T.V.!!!!!!!!! You see, when one is a writer, actor, dancer, musician; a creator of any kind, he or she does these things because they listen to that "voice" inside of them. All of us have that "voice". It is where all inspired thoughts come from....but when you have electronic screens in front, of you, speaking that voice for you... it DROWNS OUT THE VOICE! When I talk to children and aspiring writers, I always ask them to listen to the voice, turn off the T.V. and</p><p>"LISTEN...LISTEN...LISTEN.</p><p>"Now that I have moved back to Union City I am intending to open my house and community and invite people to come there to take part in writing seminars, story telling festivals, literature conferences and various events that celebrate children's literature."</p><p>Born Patricia Ann Barber in Lansing, Michigan, to parents of Russian and Ukrainian descent on one side and Irish on the other, Patricia Polacco grew up in both California and Michigan. Her school year was spent in Oakland, California, and summers in her beloved Michigan. She describes her family members as marvelous storytellers. "My fondest memories are of sitting around a stove or open fire, eating apples and popping corn while listening to the old ones tell glorious stories about their homeland and the past. We are tenacious traditionalists and sentimentalists.... With each retelling our stories gain a little more Umph!"</p><p>Studying in the United States and Australia, Patricia Polacco has earned an M.F.A. and a Ph. D. in art history, specializing in Russian and Greek painting, and iconographic history. She is a museum consultant on the restoration of icons. As a participant in many citizen exchange programs for writers and illustrators, Patricia Polacco has traveled extensively in Russia as well as other former Soviet republics. She continues to support programs that encourage Russo-American friendships and understanding. She is also deeply involved in inner-city projects here in the U.S. that promote the peaceful resolution of conflict and encourage art and literacy programs.</p><p>The mother of a grown son and a daughter, Patricia Polacco currently resides in Michigan, where she has a glorious old farm that was built during the time of Lincoln.</p><p>copyright � 2000 by Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers.

Polacco's artwork is as strong as ever in a warm story that celebrates imaginary friends. The young, pigtailed narrator introduces Emma Kate, a handsome gray elephant. "We do just about everything together!" says the girl, and, indeed, the following spreads show the friends walking to school, swinging at recess, and reading and dreaming together. When the girl tells her parents about the fun she has with Emma Kate, they respond, "You have such an imagination," indicating that the elephant is imaginary. But in Polacco's expertly rendered, energetic graphite drawings, Emma Kate is such a solid presence that children, particularly those with imaginary friends, will feel that even if Emma Kate is imagined, the friendship is real. Familiar scenes at school and home extend the story's comforting tone, and the few bright spots of paint, which stand out strongly against the black-and-white drawings (the girl's red dress is a constant focal point), reinforce the delicious sense of two worlds overlapping. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Sizes, roles, and relationships are among the items that change from page to page. At the start, a cloth doll blows chicks into soap bubbles which float across the page to where three chicks hold out a leaf to catch them. An array of other odd-sized animals and people watch. On subsequent pages readers progress through a line of static inanimate objects, to more activity by the chicks, a cat, and a child. Disorder mounts as the neat lines of objects begin to change: the plump business man's head is replaced by such things as a pear, scissors, and a feather. At last the lines are abandoned; riotous activity in which fish fly, mushrooms play the saxophone, snails race motorcycles, and other equally impossible juxtapositions fill the pages. This book should be popular in classrooms with pre- and beginning readers. The incongruities and constantly changing relationships should amuse some children for hours, while others may just find it puzzling. Its awkward size and shape will make it almost impossible to shelve. It's ideal for creative classroom use and one-to-one sharing, but it is not likely to move on its own. Anno's books are more satisfactory alternatives. Louise L. Sherman, Anna C. Scott School, Leonia, <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.This unique, album-sized volume (16 10) initially seems cumbersome, but readers will quickly discover that it is in excellent proportion to the material contained inside. A wordless story follows a progression of small events: chicks in bubbles waft gently across a spread. Household objects, barnyard animals and fantastic figures (a traffic policeman with many arms, for example) appear, disappear and turn up again to interact with each other in a way that borders on surreal. The more a child retains from successive viewings, the fuller the story becomes. Bordered in black ink, the colored illustrations convey not only the minute details of the design, but also the broadly comic, somersaulting action of several main characters. The burgeoning story line will inspire lively discussion during lap-time readings.

It's an important religious event, but for children it can be, well, kind of a snooze. This one-of-a-kind haggadah will change that.

He is committed to bringing the fruits of academic research to wider audiences through his popular newspaper columns in the Calgary Jewish newspapers.

And I, Uncle Eli, am just the right one to make sure that this year you will have lots of fun. Instead of just sitting there twiddling your hands while the grown-ups read words that you don't understand, I've brought you a special Haggadah to read. It'll keep you in stitches! It's just what you need! I wrote it for children like you and your friends, who hardly can wait for the seder to end. <p>It's just the right thing for a silly young boy- a Haggadah you'll learn to adore and enjoy." </p><p>Then, waving his finger and wiggling his ears, he stuck his right hand in his tangled white beard and from somewhere down deep in that jungle of hair he pulled out a book, which he held in the air. It's the same fun Haggadah you're reading today. Don't let your folks see it! They'll take it away. You might want to hide it where no one can see, under the table, on top of your knee. It'll be our own secret. They won't understand why you cover your mouth with the back of your hand to stifle the laughs that burst out all the time. -It's your own special secret, and Eli's ...and mine!</p></p><h2>Screams in the Night (Volume 12) (Sugar Creek Gang Original Series)</h2><p>Travel to Pass Lake, Minnesota, with the Sugar Creek Gang.

Evans presents the most important archaeological discoveries that shed light on the world of Jesus of Nazareth. Evans takes on many sensational claims that have been proposed in recent books and peddled in the media, and uses actual archaeological findings to uncover the truth about several key pieces of Jesus' world. For example, what was the village of Nazareth actually like in the time of Jesus? Did synagogues really exist, as the Gospels say? What does archaeology tell us about the ruling priests who condemned Jesus to death? Has the tomb of Jesus really been found, as has been claimed? Evans's engaging prose enables readers to understand and critique the latest theories--both the sober and the sensational--about who Jesus was and what he lived and died for.<p>Questions for discussion and reflection are available at www.wjkbooks.com, making this book ideal for group or individual study.</p></p><p>Craig A. Evans is Payzant Distinguished Professor of New Testament at Acadia Divinity College, Acadia University, in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada. The author or editor of more than fifty books and hundreds of articles, Evans is a regular guest on many national media outlets, including Dateline NBC, The History Channel, The Discovery Channel, and BBC. He is an internationally distinguished authority and lecturer on the historical Jesus. For more information, visit craigaevans.com."A masterful, erudite, and well-written review of the archaeology of the world of Jesus. Highly recommended for scholars and students alike." Shimon Gibson, Chair of the Department of Archaeology, University of the Holy Land, Jerusalem, and author of <i>The Final Days of Jesus: Archaeology as Evidence</i><br><br>"This book, by a leading New Testament scholar, is a user-friendly introduction to what the main issues are, and what archaeology can contribute to the search for the Jesus of history. Evan's book is a fine and useful entry point for considering important but often neglected sources and their impact on our understanding of the historical Jesus." Anders Runesson, Associate Professor of New Testament and Early Judaism, McMaster University<br><br>"Craig Evans has done a favor for the lay public, college students, seminary students, and likely more than a few scholars in the writing of this book. We expect clarity, accuracy, and detailed knowledge from Evans, and he delivers it. Readers at many levels will be grateful for being spared archaeological jargon and for his many insights." James F. Strange, Professor of Religious Studies and Director of Graduate Studies, University of South Florida<br><br>"Although written for non-experts, this up-to-date survey of a truly fascinating topic has much to teach the experts, too. Particularly noteworthy is the thought-provoking case for widespread literacy in Jesus' Jewish world, a case that goes against much recent work." Dale C. Allison Jr., Errett M. Grable Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity, Pittsburgh Theological Seminary<br><br>"Craig Evans has a gift for synthesizing large swaths of complicated, technical material, identifying its most significant implications, and making it accessible to non-specialists. Scholars, students, and general readers will benefit from this engaging overview of how archaeological finds illuminate the life of Jesus, from Galilee to the grave." Mark A. Chancey, Associate Professor of Religious Studies, Southern Methodist University<br><br>"In 1943 F. F. Bruce, the distinguished New Testament scholar wrote a classic work, <i>The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable?</i> Many challenges to the credibility of the Gospels have been raised since then by some skeptical scholars. Craig Evans, with a mastery of all of the relevant archaeological, inscriptional and literary evidence answers in a lucid exposition the question discussed by Bruce with a resounding 'Yes'." Edwin M. Yamauchi, Professor Emeritus of History, Miami University</p><h2>He Chose The Nails What God Did to Win Your Heart</h2><p><p>The wood. The thorns. The nails. Christ's sacrifice has defined the very essence of mankind's faith for the past 2000 years. And now, Max Lucado invites you to examine the cross, contemplate its purpose, and celebrate its significance with <i>He Chose the Nails.</i> With his warm, caring style, Max examines the symbols surrounding Christ's crucifixion, revealing the claims of the cross and asserting that if they are true, then Christianity itself is true. The supporting evidence either makes the cross the single biggest hoax of all time, or the hope of all humanity. More than a book, the campaign includes the first stand-alone workbook, leaders guide, and video package from Max, as well as a praise &amp; worship CD from Here to Him music featuring several of today's favorite Christian artists.</p></p><p>Reading a Max Lucado book is as comfortable as having coffee and conversation with a close friend. <i>He Chose the Nails: What God Did to Win Your Heart</i> is signature Lucado: warm, conversational storytelling blended with scripture, humor, and vulnerability. <p> Lucado invites us to understand the symbols surrounding Christ's crucifixion and celebrate the significance of the promises they offer. From the sign in different languages tacked to the cross ("I will speak to you in your language") to the burial clothing ("I can turn your tragedy into triumph"), he speaks of each symbol as a "gift of grace" that reveals God's love for mankind.</p><p> Lucado takes us to Calvary and shows us our sins nailed between the hand of Jesus and the cross. "You've made some bad choices in life, haven't you," writes Lucado. "You've chosen the wrong friends, maybe the wrong career, even the wrong spouse. You look back over your life and say, 'If only I could make up for those bad choices.' You can. One good choice for eternity offsets a thousand bad ones on earth. The choice is yours."</p><p> Whether he's bantering around phrases like "the hall monitors of holiness" or crafting a deeper expository on the crown of thorns, Lucado neatly balances the task of making his words accessible to a broad audience while delivering a meaty message on God's greatest sacrifice. Pick up this insightful read, and you'll be glad you made the choice. <i>--Cindy Crosby</i></p>More than 120 million readers have found comfort in the writings of&nbsp;<b>Max Lucado</b>.

He is a multiple Nebula Award finalist who lives in Georgia with his wife Maureen.</p>Paul Boehmer&#39;s resonant voice and excellent acting add some weight and color to this pedestrian sci-fi yarn, which takes the listener through most of the time-traveling tropes. When Adrian Shelbourne&#39;s father, a prominent physicist, develops a time machine and disappears, Adrian and his friend, Dave, set off to find him, launching a prolonged series of time-travel tourism jaunts and tricks to help them escape when things get dangerous. Most of the twists and turns are entirely predictable, and impatience brought on by waiting for the characters to catch up may encourage the listener to perform his or her own time travel on the story by fast-forwarding to the end.

He was awarded the Prince of Asturias Prize in 2006. His work has been translated into more than forty languages. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.Auster (Leviathan, 1992, etc.) departs from his usual cerebral fiction for this quick trip into Doctorow Land--a mytho-historical tale that invokes the American '20s, complete with glamorous gangsters and legendary sports stars. Writing in his anec-dotage, the septuagenarian Walter Rawley recalls his moment of fame back in his youth when he toured the country as ``Walter the Wonder Boy,'' a freckle-faced bumpkin who could walk through the air. Walter's levitations were no sham, but a carefully nurtured talent developed by the mysterious Master Yehudi, a Hungarian Jewish impresario who discovered Walter on the streets of St. Louis at age nine. ``A pus-brained ragamuffin from honky-tonk row,'' the orphaned Walter eventually submits to Yehudi's grueling regimen. Yehudi's household on the Kansas prairie harbors other outcasts also: Mother Sue, a stout Sioux who once performed in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show; and Aesop, a precocious crippled black foundling admitted to Yale. Yehudi and Walter finally take their show on the road after their house is visited by the KKK, who lynch Mother Sue and Aesop. Walter's fame grows rapidly. ``In the arms of the great ambient nothingness,'' he floats above ground, astounding audiences from coast to coast. His career is interrupted by a ghost from his past, a mean-spirited uncle who wants some of the loot. Then disaster strikes: The onset of puberty destroys his gift. Life after that is never the same. Yehudi shoots himself. Walter becomes a gangster in Chicago; develops a bizarre obsession with the great pitcher Dizzy Dean; and slowly fades away into alcoholic obscurity before recovering and writing this tale. Despite intimations of allegory and parable, Auster's dizzying trip through the century is not nearly as dimensional as Moon Palace, his previous escape from the metaphysical rigors of his shorter works into the picaresque.

Shirer&#39;s new book - written in his ninth decade - explores the passionate, highly charged, and extraordinary lives of Leo and Sonya Tolstoy. It is a compelling illumination both of the nature of genius and of the universal problems of love, sex, and marriage - themes that Tolstoy played out in his great fiction and that haunted him in his tangled domestic life. Rich in anecdotes, wise, full of sweeping history, and imbued with Shirer&#39;s profound knowledge of literature and life, Love and Hatred ranks beside such works as Robert Massie&#39;s Nicholas and Alexandra and Nigel Nicolson&#39;s Portrait of a Marriage as a masterly, intuitive, and sympathetic exploration of the love/hate relationship between two famous, bigger-than-life people. Beginning in 1862, when Tolstoy committed the blunder of asking his young bride to read his diaries of his bachelor life so there should be no secrets between them, and ending with his tragic flight from home (and marriage) in 1910 while the whole world waited for news of him, Love and Hatred tells the story of a great romance between two people who could live neither together nor apart - a romance that exhausted and obsessed them both, and that forms the basis for much of Tolstoy&#39;s work. The final book of William L. Shirer&#39;s long and brilliant career, it is - appropriately - a masterly re-creation of a time, of two extraordinary people, and of the very nature of love, marriage, and old age.Given the Tolstoys' voluminous, unsparing, often shared, and ultimately rather deranged diaries, writing about this prizefight of a union is not much harder than simply showing up at ringside. Using the straight-line, calendar-like procedure of his famous Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, Shirer simply follows the count and countess through the rounds of their agonies. Shirer (who died last December) revisits Sonya's devotion as secretary (the woman copied her husband's manuscripts out by hand many times over during their composition--a Herculean task); Leo's personal renunciation of one of the most fabulous gifts of talent in world art in favor of his own brand of obnoxious humility as a Christ figure; the ensuing acolytes; the jealous and largely ignored children; the comings and goings of fellow Russian writers and disciple-ish suck-ups; Sonya's pathetic attempt to snare the attentions of the epicene composer Tanayev and thus win for herself a little well-deserved appreciation. All that's here is complete enough--less schlockily pitched than in Anne Edwards's Sonya (1981) but finally no deeper. A great man's marriage is of legitimate interest, but we need to have some sense of the greatness first. Shirer's stabs at lit crit are negligible (``Again, in the telling of that rough journey to purgatory,'' he writes apropos of Resurrection, ``Tolstoy is wonderful in his descriptions. And he introduces some memorable characters...''), and even his historical references to the foment of Russian society churning around the Tolstoys, to which they certainly contributed, are bare, slack, and unshaped. A.N. Wilson's Tolstoy isn't challenged here by Shirer; it remains the best portrait of the man and the work and the marriage, the troika without any one part of which nothing seems to really move forward. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

There was a time when Christians gathered around tables, included the strangers and the poor, ate together, and talked about Jesus. This form of church occurred mostly during the first three hundred years of Christianity, and was highly effective in bringing lost people to Jesus. While the church of today is very meaningful to Christ-followers, it is failing to help our lost neighbors find their way to the Savior. That is no small concern for Jesus' churches, all of which are called to be in the rescue business. <br><br> This little book examines what it might be like for a traditional church to plant a Dinner Church in a nearby hurting neighborhood. Revelation 3:20 makes it clear that Jesus still wants to have dinner with sinners. That likely means he wants his church to set the table.</p><p></p><h2>In Search of the Medicine Buddha: A Himalayan Journey</h2><p>In 1987 David Crow journeyed to Nepal in search of teachings in Tibetan medicine and Buddhist meditation. For the next ten years, he studied with many teachers. Using his newfound knowledge, Crow opened a clinic in Kathmandu and another in a small mountain village, where he treated beggars from the street as well as high abbots of monasteries. This colorful and captivating story interweaves medical teachings with insights into Tibetan Buddhism, evoking the beauty and wonder of a faraway land.</p><p><b>David Crow</b>, L.Ac., is a licensed acupuncturist, herbalist, and aromatherapist; dietary counselor; Buddhist meditation instructor; writer; photographer; and teacher of natural health and healing. One of the first Westerners to complete acupuncture training in the United States, he lectures extensively on natural healing. He lives in Big Sur, California. <p> <b>To hear an interview with David Crow, check out www.talktotara.com under "authors".</b> </p>In a blend of medical anthropology and autobiographical essay, Crow introduces the reader to Tibetan and Ayurvedic medicine as taught to him by leading Tibetan and Nepalese physicians in Katmandu in Nepal. The book also weaves together Buddhist philosophy, Nepalese culture, and a bit of history but focuses primarily on various aspects of Sange Menla, the Medicine Buddha (the manifestation of healing in the Buddhist religious pantheon). Crow, a licensed acupuncturist and herbalist, examines such topics as herbal remedies, alchemy, women's roles in Ayurvedic medicine and in Buddhist culture, massage, meditation, and the use of mercury as a highly effective but very dangerous healing agent. Crow's book begins with his journey to Nepal in 1988 but does not provide many chronological reference points thereafter. The author also does not clearly explain the relationship between Ayurvedic and Tibetan medicine and does not provide a systematic examination of either healing tradition. The book is certainly interesting and provides valuable information but really seems better suited to popular reading than serious study.

Here Hass extends and deepens his ongoing explorations of nature and human history, solitude, and the bonds of children, parents, and lovers. Here his passion for apprehending experience with language--for <em>creating</em> experience with language--finds supple form in poems that embrace all that is alive and full of joy. <em>Sun Under Wood</em> is the most impressive collection yet from one of our most accomplished poets.</p></p><p>Robert Hass's <i>Sun Under Wood</i>, his fourth poetry collection in 25 years and the winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award, appeared in the middle of his high-profile stint as poet laureate of the United States. Putting into practice the <i>ars poetica</i> of his <i>Twentieth Century Pleasures</i> essays, these poems gain altitude through association with each other, especially the clever division of labor between "Layover" and "Notes on 'Layover.'" The concerns of the book expand and contract, offering up such memorable passages as the third stanza of "Our Lady of the Snows": <blockquote> Though mostly when I think of myself<br> at that age, I am standing at my older brother's closet<br> studying the shirts, <br> convinced that I could be absolutely transformed<br> by something I could borrow. <br> And the days churned by, <br> navigable sorrow. <br> </blockquote> Aside from sounding an unexpected rhyme, this "navigable sorrow" betrays Hass as a poet of sensibility. What elevates him from preciousness is a powerful need to engage and indulge--to "navigate"--memories of his alcoholic mother and his own painful divorce. <i>Sun Under Wood</i>, in other words, is the book Robert Lowell would have written had he grown up in California. The raccoon Hass confronts in "Iowa City: Early April" seems to have stepped right out of Lowell's "Skunk Hour," but instead of moaning, "I myself am hell ... nobody's here," Hass muses, "That his experience of his being and mine of his and his of mine were things entirely apart, / ...And as for my experience of myself, it comes and goes, I'm not sure it's any one thing...." Such universal emotions are hard to find words for, but throughout <i>Sun Under Wood</i>Hass speaks with a clear, disturbing, and urgent voice. <i>--Edward Skoog</i><p>Robert Hass was born in San Francisco. His books of poetry include <em>The Apple Trees at Olema</em> (Ecco, 2010), Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award winner <em>Time and Materials</em> (Ecco, 2008), <em>Sun Under Wood</em> (Ecco, 1996), <em>Human Wishes</em> (1989), <em>Praise</em> (1979), and <em>Field Guide</em> (1973), which was selected by Stanley Kunitz for the Yale Younger Poets Series. Hass also co-translated several volumes of poetry with Nobel Laureate Czeslaw Milosz and authored or edited several other volumes of translation, including Nobel Laureate Tomas Transtr�mer's <em>Selected Poems</em> (2012) and <em>The Essential Haiku: Versions of Basho, Buson, and Issa</em> (1994). His essay collection <em>Twentieth Century Pleasures: Prose on Poetry</em> (1984) received the National Book Critics Circle Award.

He has been a pioneer in leadership education and a leading figure in intra-Jewish dialogue and the development of pluralism. An Orthodox rabbi and Harvard Ph.D., Rabbi Greenberg has been a seminal thinker in confronting the Holocaust as an historical transforming event and Israel as the Jewish assumption of power and the beginning of a third era in Jewish history. Rabbi Greenberg has published articles and monographs on Jewish thought and religion, and is the subject of a book, Living in the Image of God: Jewish Teachings to Perfect the World (Conversations with Rabbi Irving Greenberg as Conducted by Shalom Freedman), published by Jason Aronson Inc. He is currently President of CHAverIM Kol Yisrael/Jewish Life Network, a Michael and Judy Steinhardt Foundation, which develops new institutions and projects in religion, education, and culture to strengthen the inner life of American Jewry.The diverse, nondelineated material in this book precludes its easy use as a handbook, distinguishing it from such works as Leo Trepp's traditional Complete Book of Jewish Observance ( LJ 10/15/86) or Arthur Waskow's innovative Seasons of Our Joy (Summit Bks., 1986) . The chapters on each major and minor holiday are crammed with facts, anecdotes, and personal reflections; the Hassidic and Kabbalistic tales contain moral messages that reinforce Greenberg's perspective. Indeed, Greenberg appears to use the holidays as a vehicle for expressing his own philosophy of Judaism. There are meaningful interpretations, but they can best be appreciated by readers with a basic understanding of Jewish principles. Carol R.

Within the thousands of options to choose from, there can be as much variation in flavor and quality as there is in, say, wine or cheese, and chocolate is very much the same type of product. While you may buy a bar of beautifully wrapped chocolate from a chic urban boutique, all chocolate starts its life as an agricultural crop, and its quality depends on the care taken by the farmer and those processing the beans at an early stage. The final confection reflects the skill and sensibility of the manufacturer, whether that's an industrial giant such as Hershey's� or a hands-on artisan like one of the many small chocolatiers that have sprung up around the world. Understanding how chocolate is created can help you make the best decisions about which variety to use in cooking and for eating.</p><p><b>Chocolate's delicious journey from bean to bar</b><br> All real chocolate comes from the cocoa bean (also called cacao bean), the fruit of a tree, Theobroma cacao, that only grows in the tropics. Much of the quality of the chocolate will depend on the origin and quality of the beans. There are three main types of cacao: Forestero (and a subtype called Nacional), which has a robust chocolate flavor but not much finesse; Trinitario, a good middle quality; and Criollo, considered the premium bean. The beans are fermented after being harvested, dried, cleaned, roasted, and finally shelled, to produce the centers, called nibs.</p><p>These nibs are then pulverized or ground into a smooth liquid that's called chocolate liquor (although it contains no alcohol). When the chocolate liquor cools, it forms solid blocks.</p><p>Chocolate liquor is the basis for all things chocolate. Pure chocolate liquor is very dark and bitter and has only two components -- cocoa solids and cocoa butter. The solids give chocolate its characteristic dark, strong flavor, and the cocoa butter translates to a smooth mouth-feel.</p><p>In its natural state, chocolate liquor contains a little more than half (50% to 58%) cocoa butter and the rest is chocolate solids. Early on, producers learned that by increasing the cocoa butter, they could create chocolate with a better sheen and smoother texture. So they developed a high-pressure filter process that breaks down chocolate liquor and separates the solids from the butter. They could then manipulate the chocolate to produce a range of styles.</p><p>To create eating chocolate, sugar and flavorings are added to the cocoa butter and solids, and the mixture undergoes hours of a process called conching, using rollers that refine all the particles in sugar and create the luscious mouth-feel we crave in chocolate. While some sugar is needed to make pure chocolate palatable, the best examples contain a high percentage of real chocolate and only small amounts of sugar or other additives.</p></p><h2>Well-Preserved: Recipes and Techniques for Putting Up Small Batches of Seasonal Foods</h2><p><b>A collection of 30 small batch preserving recipes and 90 recipes in which to use the preserved goods for anyone who's ever headed to their local farmers' market reciting the mantra "I will not overbuy" but has lumbered home with bags overflowing with delicious summer strawberries, zucchini blossoms, and tomatoes, or autumn apples, pears, and cauliflower. </b><br><br> Preserving recipes like Marinated Baby Artichokes are followed by recipes for dishes like Marinated Artichoke and Ricotta Pie and Sausages with Marinated Baby Artichokes; a Three-Citrus Marmelade recipe is followed by recipes for Chicken Wings Baked with Three-Citrus Marmelade, Shrmp with Three-Citrus Marmelade and Lime, and Crepes with Three-Citrus Marmelade, and so on.<br><br> In this book, Eugenia Bone, a New Yorker whose Italian father was forever canning everything from olives to tuna, describes the art of preserving in an accessible way.

The season is short, so in the months that follow I am always grateful that I have taken the time to put some up. These preserves are great used in both savory and sweet dishes. I love having them on hand for unexpected company. All I have to do is dump 1&#x2044;2 cup into a wineglass and top with whipped cream for a surprisingly elegant dessert.

Place the jars in a big pot with a rack in the bottom and add enough water to cover the jars by 3 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat to medium and gently boil the jars for 20 minutes. Turn off the heat, allow the jars to rest in the water for 5 minutes, and then remove. Allow the jars to cool, untouched, for 4 to 6 hours. Check the seals and store in a cool, dry place for up to a year.

Told with compassion and a deft hand, <i>Dark at the Crossing</i> is an exploration of loss, of second chances, and of why we choose to believe--a trenchantly observed novel of raw urgency and power.<br><br><b>&#x201c;Promises to be one of the most essential books of 2017&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Esquire</i></b></p><p><b>ELLIOT ACKERMAN</b>, author of the critically acclaimed novel <i>Green on Blue, </i>is based out of Istanbul, where he has covered the Syrian Civil War since 2013.

Cleaned by his sweat, he swaddled himself in a complimentary bathrobe, went up to his room and took a long shower. Then he went back to sleep, waking naked on his bed an hour later. Downstairs for a late breakfast, he ate three buttered croissants with jam.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The concierge found Haris in the large, empty dining room, its circular tables set with fine crystal as if waiting for a party that would never come. Leaning over Haris, the concierge grasped the lapels of his suit jacket, where he wore a pinned insignia of crossed gold keys. He asked Haris something in Turkish. Haris didn&#x2019;t speak Turkish and shrugged back, his mouth still full of flaky croissant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The concierge tried Arabic: &#x201c;How has your stay been?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Good, thank you,&#x201d; said Haris.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Business or pleasure?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Business,&#x201d; answered Haris. There was no other reason to come to Antep, an industrial backwater along Turkey&#x2019;s southern border with Syria.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The concierge looked at the stuffed hiking pack propped against the leg of Haris&#x2019;s chair. &#x201c;Checking out then?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris reached into a deep internal pocket on the pack, fishing around for his cash. He pulled out a mixed roll of Turkish lira, American dollars and Syrian pounds. He held the wad beneath the table, counting it bill by bill. The concierge hovered above him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Two hundred a night, yes?&#x201d; asked Haris, peeling six hundred lira off his roll.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The concierge nodded, eyeing Haris&#x2019;s dollars. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re American?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris handed over the money for three nights. &#x201c;Here, six hundred.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He felt the concierge taking a closer look at him: his pack, his desert--suede combat boots.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d prefer you pay in dollars,&#x201d; said the concierge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As hard as he&#x2019;d worked to become an American, Haris hated the way his new clothes and strong currency betrayed him abroad. He paid in dollars, and the concierge tucked the tight fold of twenties into his vest&#x2019;s front pocket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Allow me to find you a cab.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris nodded, then got up and went to the bathroom, leaving his heavy pack unattended in the opulent dining room. He didn&#x2019;t seem to care if everything was taken from him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It had rained the night before, and that morning the late autumn sky cleared, turning the air cold, freezing the sidewalks. Outside the Tu&#x11f;can, an old man, a Syrian, swept the slush from the hotel&#x2019;s marble front step with a rolled copy of the daily paper, Milliyet. His eyes were sheathed in wrinkles and on his head he wore a keffiyeh. It was held in place by an igal, a coiled wreath, which sat on him like the crown of perpetual defeat. Hunched over, the old man worked slowly, positioning himself so someone from the hotel might notice his pains and offer a bit of charity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The revolving door spun a turn, and the concierge and Haris stepped outside. The old man looked up at them, holding his face toward the sun. He offered a toothy, rotten grin. His eyes shifted from them to his work, clearing the last of the slush from their path. Haris reached into his pocket. His fingers felt for a coin or folded lira note. Before he could find either, the concierge flicked the toe of a polished oxford at the old man, shooing him away. The old man said nothing. He took a few steps from the Tu&#x11f;can&#x2019;s marble front and wandered onto the frozen sidewalk, where he stood like a broken piece of furniture set out in the street.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The concierge reached into his vest pocket and blew a small silver whistle. A yellow taxi with the Tu&#x11f;can&#x2019;s logo&#x2014;-a setting or rising sun, it was difficult to tell which&#x2014;-pulled in front of the hotel. Unfolding a map of Syria and southern Turkey, Haris walked to the driver&#x2019;s window. The driver rubbed his thickly stubbled cheeks as Haris traced the route from Antep to the border crossing thirty miles south, in a town called Kilis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The concierge insisted on loading Haris&#x2019;s hiking pack into the taxi. He slammed the trunk closed. &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;ll stay with us again.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With no plans to return, Haris felt uncertain what to say. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he mumbled. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out the first coin he found&#x2014;-one lira, a meager sum. He palmed it over to the concierge, who took the gratuity with the same composure a gentleman takes an insult.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris slammed the taxi&#x2019;s yellow door, happy to be leaving the Tu&#x11f;can and Antep. The concierge headed back toward the hotel, crossing the marble step that had been cleared of slush. Appreciating this clean patch, he glanced to where the old man lingered on the frozen sidewalk. Their eyes met, and the old man straightened himself, fixing his keffiyeh, smoothing its tasseled ends over his narrow shoulders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris&#x2019;s taxi pulled into the street. From its window, he saw the old man ambling toward the Tu&#x11f;can&#x2019;s revolving door. The concierge stood on the cleared marble step. He handed the old man Haris&#x2019;s one lira for his labor. As the taxi took the last turn toward the highway, Haris glimpsed the old man&#x2019;s contorted, angry expression when he tucked the coin into his pocket, the concierge having passed along Haris&#x2019;s insult.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The cab followed the D850, a highway constructed as sturdily as anything Haris had seen in Michigan, where he&#x2019;d brought his sister after his first war. Removing his map, Haris traced the D850 with his finger as it ran out of Antep, or Gaziantep as the map read, though Haris had yet to meet anyone who called it such.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was a city of two names with three meanings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris could recognize that Antep was a corruption of the Arabic ayn tayyib, which meant &#x201c;the good spring.&#x201d; After the democratic revolutions of two springs past, it augured well to return through a city with this name. A hundred years before, the Turkish parliament had appended the &#x201c;Gazi&#x201d; or ghazi, meaning &#x201c;hero,&#x201d; after the city&#x2019;s citizens repulsed a French siege during the war of independence. Yet the city&#x2019;s oldest name, spoken in a dead language, and in this way a hidden language, had a slightly different meaning. In Aramaic the word is ayn debo, &#x201c;the spring of the wolf.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris found where the D850 ran out of Antep and intersected the D400, which crossed from Turkey into Syria, passing through cities like Ar--Raqqa and Deir ez--Zor, which had become infamous after two years of civil war. But the route remained anonymous, connecting places yet being no place. When the D400 entered Iraq, it became Highway 10. But always it was the same road: black, straight, its name switching with borders while every other part of it remained unchanged. Haris continued to trace the road with his finger until it spilled into a flat brown Iraqi sprawl along the Euphrates River&#x2014;-Nasiriya&#x2014;-his birthplace and, before the war, his home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of his family, he had no single memory of them together, his mother having died in childbirth with his sister, Samia, when he was six. His first home had been on the riverbank. The high marsh grass abutting a simple compound of thick, coarse cement, his mother walking him down to the bank through the brushing grass, his father returning from whatever construction job he worked with the same cement hard on his clothes&#x2014;-memory was texture. Soft grass. Hard cement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris leaned his head against the cracked window. The cold glass touched the bald spot, which, only in the last few months, had spread from his crown. His reddish hair was unusually light, an uncommon but not impossible shade for an Arab, evidence of some recessive trait. Past the glass, farmers&#x2019; fields flanked the road, spanning in all directions. Clods of harvested earth littered the fields. They stank with a wet--dirt smell. In places the dead stalks of the harvest burned in the dawn, which seemed to rise from the land itself, and the farmers cleared the fields, readying them for winter and the next season&#x2019;s planting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris thought how fertile and lush the land seemed. To live here was to be blessed. He&#x2019;d always believed that was why life in Nasiriya had been violent and poor&#x2014;-but for the river the land was desert, everything scarce, scarcity breeding violence. Just across this border, in Syria, around cities like Aleppo and Azaz, the land was the same as what passed by Haris&#x2019;s window&#x2014;-rich, wet, harvested. These three years, violence had spread there, as surely as if the land were desert, the people failing the land and what had been given them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The meter on the dash steadily climbed, blinking close to a hundred Turkish lira. Strewn across the soaked and smoky farm fields were the sagging tents of refugee families. Outside the tents, lost--eyed men sat on plastic chairs, watching the highway. Children played in the churned mud. They chased a dog whose ribs sucked at its sides, taunting it with sticks. When the dog got away, they taunted a child who was slower than the dog.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The rows of tents thickened as the D850 ran closer to Kilis. At the town&#x2019;s limit, the refugees disappeared. The streets became clean. Curbs sprung up on the side of the road, checkered yellow and white, the paint fresh. Where many roads met, roundabouts had been built. Their centers were planted with flowers, tulips mostly. Everywhere traffic lights hung between side posts, changing in unison, swaying on their wires in an uneven wind. The war and the border were less than a kilometer away, and Haris felt there was something cruel in how Kilis thrived despite its proximity to suffering.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The cabdriver pulled up to a stoplight, for a final left turn. From the roadside, a pack of children, their clothes oily with filth, rushed the taxi. Their voices chattered wild as morning birds. The cabdriver ignored their pleas until one boy knocked a little fist against the taxi&#x2019;s door. The cabdriver rolled down his window to curse the boy. Before he could, the children reached their arms inside, clamoring for some charity. The cabdriver swatted at them, shouting the only words of Arabic he seemed to know: &#x201c;Airy fic! Airy fic!&#x201d; But the children wouldn&#x2019;t &#x201c;fuck off.&#x201d; They wouldn&#x2019;t move. A pair now stood in front of the taxi, blocking its way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the cabdriver, Haris understood the pleading boys. He rolled down his window and pointed to a plastic shopping bag carried by the eldest, who was no more than fourteen, just a child with an Adam&#x2019;s apple, his jet--black hair slicked back with what was likely pomade but could well have been engine grease. This boy offered up the plastic sack to Haris. The others calmed, sensing Haris might buy one of the cheap knickknacks they hawked. Before they could strike a deal, the cabdriver pointed to the pair who had stepped in front of his taxi. The boy with the black hair nodded in their direction. The pair stepped out of the way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris fingered through the plastic bag&#x2014;-a wooden comb, fingernail clippers, a cigarette lighter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Five lira for anything,&#x201d; announced the boy with the black hair, his mouth curling into a sly grin around his wide--spaced teeth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris reached through the window, taking the lighter from the bag, which he passed back to them. &#x201c;How about this?&#x201d; he asked, digging a few coins from his pants pocket. A younger boy had approached Haris&#x2019;s window. He was skinny, his face grained in dirt, but he had very clear gray eyes, which watched Haris from behind a pair of thick glasses, their right lens missing. Instead of passing his coins to the sly boy with the black hair, Haris reached toward this other, weaker boy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before Haris could pay, the light went green. The cabdriver sped through the intersection, pinning Haris to his seat. As he sat up, Haris tossed a handful of change out his window. He then glanced through the cab&#x2019;s rear windshield. The boys scrambled down the road. The boy with the black hair pried their bodies apart as they wrestled for what Haris had left behind, all except for the younger boy, who, very calmly, stood on the curb and cleaned the one lens of his glasses with the dirty hem of his shirt.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The border crossing in Kilis smelled of sharp, acrid smoke. A pair of Turkish flags&#x2014;-a white crescent pinching a white, five--pointed star on a red banner&#x2014;-flanked what to Haris looked like a rest stop on the interstate. Just past the crossing, in the Syrian town of Azaz, explosions came&#x2014;-CRUMP, CRUMP, CRUMP&#x2014;-the noise like soda cans crushed underfoot. The impacts set off a few distant car alarms. Smoke towered upward, running along the horizon like black stitches, fastening earth to sky.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris shouldered his heavy hiking pack. He stood in the dust of the gravel parking lot. The cabdriver pulled back onto the road. It had been a few years since Haris had come near such violence. He remained motionless, transfixed by its familiar power, as if he&#x2019;d just put an old name to a forgotten face.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Refugees from the morning&#x2019;s fighting crowded the roadside. Some sat straddling their cheap, flimsy suitcases. Others squatted in the dirt with nothing. Few spoke. Those who did whispered. The crowd&#x2019;s attention held on Azaz.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris checked his phone for an email from Saladin1984, his contact and fixer in the Northern Storm, a supposedly good brigade of the Free Syrian Army. There were no messages. It was Saladin1984 who&#x2019;d recruited him to the cause, forwarding along a steady stream of treatises, manifestos and videos, each with an array of political demands that at times Haris found dizzying despite his growing commitment to these ideas. Some materials called for the establishment of a free and democratic Syria, others the removal of President Bashar al--Assad, and many a combination of the two. Haris now composed Saladin1984 a message, explaining that he&#x2019;d arrived and was ready to cross the border. As he finished, another CRUMP came, then more smoke, followed by the manic pop, pop, pop of rifle fire. A collective sigh went up from those stuck along the border, as if in a crowded airport terminal a final flight&#x2019;s cancellation had just been announced. A few of the refugees lay down on the cold earth, as though they&#x2019;d chosen to take a nap. Others wandered aimlessly along the road toward Kilis. In the parking lot&#x2019;s corner, some pressed into a small caf� run out of an abandoned shipping container, where a squat Syrian man with a push--broom mustache served bitter tea in curved glass cups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You came to fight, Haris told himself, looking at the distant smoke blooming from Azaz. They&#x2019;re fighting right there. You&#x2019;ve fought before&#x2014;- No, he reminded himself&#x2014;- You&#x2019;ve been around fighting before. There&#x2019;s a big difference. So are you going to do what you came to do?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Haris tightened down the straps on his hiking pack. He plodded toward the Plexiglas guard booth at the border crossing, feeling the refugees&#x2019; puzzled looks on him&#x2014;-it was absur...</p></p><h2>The Question of Jean-Jacques Rousseau</h2><p>This is an example product description.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>A Wolf Story</h2><p>This tale of savage conflict and enduring faith tells of a wolf&#39;s passion to overcome evil, and the battle for victory in the deep woods.

He began writing fiction at a very young age, selling his first story to <i>True Detective</i> when he was only fourteen. Thompson eventually wrote twenty-nine novels, all but three of which were published as paperback originals. Thompson also wrote two screenplays (for the Stanley Kubrick films &#x201c;The Killing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Paths of Glory&#x201d;). An outstanding crime writer, the world of his fiction is rife with violence and corruption. In examining the underbelly of human experience and American society in particular, Thompson&#x2019;s work at its best is both philosophical and experimental. Several of his novels have been filmed by American and French directors, resulting in classic noir including <b>The Killer Inside Me</b> (1952), <b>After Dark My Sweet</b> (1955), and <b>The Grifters</b> (1963).</p><h2>Frankenstein</h2><p>This Junior Classic edition has been carefully condensed and adapted from the original version.

This memoir takes us from his childhood in Atlanta, Georgia, through the early 1980s. This may be a case where listening is better than reading. Jordan has a rich and melodious voice; he reads clearly, and where needed, with much emotion. It's hard to imagine a better reader of his sometimes humorous, sometimes painful, but always moving story of life before, during, and since the Civil Rights movement. R.E.K.

This sympathetic yet even-handed book records for the first time the complete story of SNCC's evolution, of its successes and its difficulties in the ongoing struggle to end white repression.</p><p>At its birth, SNCC was composed of black college students who shared an ideology of moral radicalism. This ideology, with its emphasis on nonviolence, challenged Southern segregation. SNCC students were the earliest civil rights fighters of the Second Reconstruction. They conducted sit-ins at lunch counters, spearheaded the freedom rides, and organized voter registration, which shook white complacency and awakened black political consciousness. In the process, Carson shows, SNCC changed from a group that endorsed white middle-class values to one that questioned the basic assumptions of liberal ideology and raised the fist for black power. Indeed, SNCC's radical and penetrating analysis of the American power structure reached beyond the black community to help spark wider social protests of the 1960s, such as the anti-Vietnam War movement.</p><p>Carson's history of SNCC goes behind the scene to determine why the group's ideological evolution was accompanied by bitter power struggles within the organization. Using interviews, transcripts of meetings, unpublished position papers, and recently released FBI documents, he reveals how a radical group is subject to enormous, often divisive pressures as it fights the difficult battle for social change.</p></p><p>The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC, pronounced &#39;snick&#39;) emerged from the seemingly sterile American political landscape of the 1950s, thrived amidst the mass struggles of the 1960s, and died in the barren atmosphere of repression, divisiveness, and self-absorption of the early 1970s. As racial discord and discontent broke through a facade of accommodation, a series of isolated acts of resistance ignited the modern African-American freedom struggle.Clayborne Carson is Professor of History at Stanford University and Director of the Martin Luther King, Jr., Papers Project.</p><h2>A Small Place in Italy</h2><p><p>In 1967, Eric Newby and his wife Wanda acquired &#x201c; I Castagni&#x201d; (The Chestnuts) , a small and ruined farmhouse in the foothills of the Apuan Alps on the borders of Liguria and northern Tuscany. They were the first foreigners to live in the area, and for 25 years, they remained the only ones. This book recounts the Newbys` life in their house in a forgotten era. It describes how they pulled the house back from the brink of collapse, their enduring friendship with the neighbouring contadini, who welcomed them - whether eating, drinking, harvesting grapes and olives, or hunting for fungus and wild asparagus - from the moment they arrived.</p></p><p>Eric Newby was born in London in 1919. In 1938, he joined the four-masted Finnish barque Moshulu as an apprentice and sailed in the last Grain Race from Australia to Europe, by way of Cape Horn. During World War II, he served in the Black Watch and the Special Boat Section. In 1942, he was captured and remained a prisoner-of-war until 1945. He subsequently married the girl who helped him to escape, and for the next fifty years, his wife Wanda was at his side on many adventures. After the war, he worked in the fashion business and book publishing but always travelled on a grand scale, sometimes as the Travel Editor for the Observer. He was made CBE in 1994 and was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award of the British Guild of Travel Writers in 2001. Eric Newby died in 2006.As usual, Andrew Sachs gives a stellar performance in narrating this account of renovating a dilapidated farmhouse on the border of Tuscany. He rolls out nonstop Italian phrases and descriptions of local festivals as if he&#39;d been raised under an olive tree. But, alas, even the liveliest narration cannot transform 25 years in &#34;I Castagni&#34; with Eric Newby into one year in Provence with Peter Mayle. Although Newby is a highly respected travel writer, he lacks Mayle&#39;s flair for capturing colorful characters and lively dialogue. With such uninspired writing, few listeners may be tempted--even in imagination--to follow the rough road to &#34;a small place in Italy.&#34; J.C.

Having accomplished a near miracle with <em>Life After Life</em>, in which she used a literary-do-over trope to tell the story of a British woman living between and after the two World Wars, Kate Atkinson now dares to write a companion novel that focuses on <em>Life</em>&#x2019;s heroine Ursula Todd&#x2019;s brother Teddy. Never mind that careful readers of the first book came away with the impression that Teddy most often turned up dead, in this one he&#x2019;s an old man trying to come to grips with his post-War life and with a modern world and family. Switching back and forth in time (Atkinson can&#x2019;t seem to help it...) between memories of his childhood and his present, Teddy emerges as a befuddled and somewhat stodgy old-man version of himself, a startlingly oblivious husband to stalwart Nancy and a wittily rueful father to a grown up daughter (&#x201c;Viola was the solitary arrow they had shot blindly into the future, not knowing where she would land,&#x201d; Teddy thinks. &#x201c;They should have aimed better.&#x201d;) Teddy never quite got over the War and he suspects that the &#x201c;fact&#x201d; of his being alive is as arbitrary as Ursula&#x2019;s demise(s). (&#x201c;He had been reconciled to death during the war and then suddenly the war was over and there was a next day and a next day. Part of him never adjusted to having a future.&#x201d;) Scenes from his past bring back Ursula and other characters from the earlier book so that readers who&#x2019;ve come this far with Atkinson will feel a tiny thrill of recognition; but new readers needn&#x2019;t fear they&#x2019;re missing the joke. There&#x2019;s way less gimmick here than in the earlier book, and sometimes I almost longed for more; it was so provocative. But whether read alone or as a follow up, <em>A God in Ruins</em> is a novel to savor, another beautiful, tender and sly Atkinsonian glimpse into the world of a so-called ordinary mid-century British family. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p><strong>Kate Atkinson's</strong> first novel, <em>Behind the Scenes at the Museum</em>, was named England's Whitbread Book of the Year in 1996. Since then, she has written eight more ground-breaking, bestselling books, most recently <em>Life After Life</em>. She lives in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p><h2>Five Lost Classics: Tao, Huang-lao, and Yin-yang in Han China (Classics of Ancient China)</h2><p>Three schools of Taoism flourished at the beginning of the Han Dynasty in 2nd-Century B.C. China: the Lao-tzu, the Chuang-tzu, and the Huang-Lao, the last being the most influential philosophy at the court of the Han rulers. But, after Confucianism became the predominant court philosophy in the 1st Century B.C., Huang-Lao Taoism became little more than a name; its central principles virtually forgotten, its texts destroyed or lost.<br><br>In 1973, among the many unique documents discovered in the richly furnished tomb of a Han-dynasty aristocrat, were five books written on silk, primary texts of Huang-lao Taoism and Yin-yang philosophy that had been lost to mankind for more than 2,000 years. A discovery as important in China as the unearthing of the Dead Sea Scrolls was in the West, the Mawangdui texts created a sensation when they were first published, even leading to the foundation of a new religion on Taiwan. Now Robin D. S. Yates, a noted expert in Chinese history and philosophy, offers the first complete translation of these precious and unique texts to be published in a Western language.<br><br>As Professor Yates explains in his illuminating introduction to this volume, the recovery of the five lost classics sheds new light on a critical transitional period of Chinese political and intellectual history. Implicit in the texts is the assumption that a ruler who strives to align himself with the unknowable, transcendent order of the cosmos will become a "true king" capable of commanding the allegiance of a unified China. To this end, the essays deal with concrete questions of self-cultivation and political insight rather than with the abstract considerations typical of Western philosophy.<br><br>The first four texts focus on different facets of Huang-lao Taoism while the fifth is devoted to Yin-yang philosophy: The Canon: Law unfolds the essence of the Tao and explains why rulers must abide within the boundaries of the law; The Canon is largely cast as a series of stories and dialogues between the mythological Yellow Emperor and his leading officials; Designations is a collection of fifty-four aphorisms expounding the eternal dilemmas of the human condition; Tao the Origin is an essay on the origin of the Tao; The Nine Rulers, the fragmentary fifth text, is a Yin-yang essay that considers the laws of nature which effective rulers must understand and obey. It is the only Yin-yang text which has survived almost whole into the Twentieth Century, and is valuable because its philosophy is basic to the origins of Huang-Lao tradition.<br><br>Brilliantly translated by Professor Yates and prefaced with his fascinating and informative introduction, Five Lost Classics is as accessible to general readers as it is illuminating to scholars. With the publication of this volume, a document of inestimable value takes its place, after a two thousand year hiatus, in the canon of world literature and philosophy.</p><p>Robin D. S. Yates is the chairman of the department of East Asian studies and director of the Centre for East Asian Studies at McGill University. Professor Yates, who holds an (M.A. from both Oxford University and the University of California) and a Ph.D. from Harvard, has published widely on Chinese military philosophy, law, and the history of Chinese philosophy. His most acclaimed work is his collaboration with Dr. Joseph H. Needham on Vol. 5.6 of Cambridge University&#39;s Science and Civilization in China. Professor Yates and his wife, Professor Grace F. Fong, live in Montreal, Canada.The funeral objects excavated at a southern Chinese cite called Mawangdui in 1973 have proven to be some of the finest caches of "grave goods" retrieved during this century. In addition to splendid lacquerwares and silks, which have shed new light on the artistic achievements of the early Han dynasty, the diggings have yielded a treasure house of manuscripts written on silk. Noted historian Yates (McGill Univ., Montreal) correctly likens the Mawangdui texts to the Dead Sea Scrolls in the West. The author has chosen to translate five Daoist texts, documents written to advise ruling Han dynasty authorities on how to attune themselves to the cosmos at a time of rapidly changing political and social climate. His work will be especially useful to students of classical Chinese because the translation is paired with the original text, and the entire work is painstakingly annotated and preceded by an illuminating introduction and commentary.

The Zohar is a commentary on the Torah and although it is sometimes ascribed to a second-century rabbi, Simon Bar-Yochai, the form in which it is most widely known originates with Moses of Leon, a native of Granada, who died in 1305.The kabbalists believe that the undefinable origin of all things is Ein Sof - the cause of causes, the infinite, that which underlies everything. The universe emanates from the divine in successive layers called esefiroti. Everything exists in God, but God extends infinitely beyond existence. All we know and are is linked together, pervaded and maintained by the divine. According to this work, the light of God must be concealed in order to be revealed to creation. Even though the kabbalists believe that ultimately Ein Sof is beyond expression or understanding, the contemplation of God's presence in all things causes our thoughts to be purified.</p></p><p>S. L.

That meant creating awareness and security programs that make it too hard for the nasties to get to you, so they'll give up and go down the street to the Air Farce base.) </i></p><p><i> There's another reason Larry impressed me. Most people's blood type is A, B, O, maybe AB; Larry's got something unique flowing through his veins -- type </i>L-O-Y-A-L-T-Y.<i> He's not just loyal to me; he's loyal to his beliefs. There's nothing half-assed with Larry -- it's all or nothing. (You'll soon see that this is a common attribute among the Real Team personalities. There's no "gray area" -- it's black or white. Compromise is not in their vocabulary.) An example of Larry's loyalty: after I selected him, he made sure I'd consider his swim buddy from training, Frank Phillips. (Frank is the other Gold Dust Twin.) Not only did he make sure I'd interview Frank, he also coached him -- told him to volunteer for the unit and not ask any dumb questions. Larry was loyal to his swim buddy, and to his new Team; he was a believer in the unit, even before the unit existed. </i></p><p><i> Another one of Larry's assets was his skill with foreign languages. He could develop a working knowledge of a language pretty damn fast; give him a few days, and he could understand and assess conversations and written material, and express himself pretty well -- with one drawback. Whatever language, he spoke it in a south Florida drawl. That limited his effectiveness in counterintelligence operations. No real problem there. We all have talents and limitations; the key is to maximize the former and limit the latter. I'd pick other guys in the Team for the verbal stuff. </i></p><p><i> But in every other way, Larry was terrific operationally. When he wants to, he can melt into the background and become wallpaper; he's got one of those faces that you feel like you know from somewhere. He mingles well with just about anybody; he can walk up to a total stranger and start a conversation without seeming pushy or threatening. </i></p><p><i> Behind that mild-mannered exterior, his brain is always going. He always has a purpose in mind; he's always collecting data, looking for ways to achieve the mission more effectively. He never stops learning, never stops passing on all he can. </i></p><p><i> Over the years, I had the privilege of watching Larry develop as a leader. He always led from the front and demanded top performance from his subordinates. He learned from the chiefs who raised him; he spent his time in the trenches with his troops, making sure they were well prepared, militarily and personally, for what they would face. He's a hell of an instructor -- meticulous in his presentation, eager to explain the "whys" that make it all work. He never forgets that this shit was new to him once, too. I've also had the pleasure of watching him raise his two young boys with the same thoroughness and dedication. He's determined to pass on everything his father gave to him, plus whatever his "sea daddies" shared with him. </i></p><p><i> I don't want this to sound like some kind of "I love you -- you love me" Valentine, so I've got to talk about Larry's flaws. His loyalty was so strong that his first impulse was to follow my orders or wishes, even if he saw a better way. He might not even tell me about that better way. He soon learned to speak up more often, and when he did speak, I listened. I knew his ideas were backed up with thought and merit. He never talked just to hear his own voice. </i></p><p><i> Larry was and is a "temple dog." Anyone would be blessed to have him in their organization. If the United States ever needs his talents again, I know he'll be there in some shape or form.</i> </p><p> Now listen to what a growling bulldog has to say about teamwork. </p><p> <b>NAME: Larry Barrett </b></p><p><b> DOB: December 22, 1951 </b></p><p><b> HOMETOWN: DeFuniak Springs, Florida </b></p><p><b> MILITARY: United States Marine Corps; SEAL Team TWO; Mob SIX; SEAL Team SIX; Red Cell; SEAL Team FOUR, Navy liaison to the Air Force for SpecOps </b></p><p><b> HIGHEST RANK: E-9, master chief </b></p><p><b> SPECIALTY: Ordnance </b></p><p><b> CURRENT: Owner/operator, RV park and nature camp</b> </p><p> First time I was in combat was Grenada.

In 1999 she was awarded an MBE for her services to children&#39;s literature.The Whispering Mountain<br>1On a sharp autumn evening a boy stood waiting inside the high stone pillars which flanked the gateway of the Jones Academy for the Sons of Gentlemen and Respectable Tradesmen in the small town of Pennygaff.School had finished for the day some time since, and all the other scholars had gladly streamed away into the windy dusk, but still the boy hesitated, shivering with cold and indecision. Once or twice he edged close against one of the soot-blackened pillars, so that his form was almost invisible, and, leaning forward, peered out through the close-set iron railings.The street outside seemed empty. But was it really so? Very little daylight now remained. A thin yellow strip of light in the west made the shadows along the narrow cobbled way even blacker; there were too many doorways, porches, passages, and flights of steps in or behind which any number of enemies could lurk unseen. And a great bank of purple-black cloud was advancing steadily westwardacross the sky, blotting out what little light yet lingered. In a minute, torrents of rain would fall.The sound of quick footsteps behind him rang in the paved yard and the boy swung round sharply, but it was only the schoolmaster, Mr. Price, on his way home to tea."Owen Hughes!" the teacher said with displeasure. "What are you doing here? Run along, boy, run along; you should not be loitering in the grounds after school has ended. Where are your books? And why have you no coat? It will rain directly. Your good grandfather will be wondering where you have got to. Hurry along now."Mr. Price said all this as he passed the boy at a rapid pace, without pausing, meanwhile buttoning his own greatcoat against the huge drops of rain which were beginning to strike heavily on the flagged pavement. Owen's "Yes, sir," followed him, but he did not turn his head to see whether he had been obeyed, and Owen did not move from his position by the gate despite the downpour, which, now commencing in good earnest, soon drenched his thin nankeen jacket.Intent on his scrutiny of the empty street, Owen did not even notice that he had begun to shiver with wet and cold, and that the scrap of paper which he rolled between his fingers had become sodden and indecipherable. Its short message was printed on his memory.WE SHALL BE WAITING FOR YOU AFTER SCHOOLThe message, written in large, uneven capitals, was unsigned, but Owen was in no doubt as to where it had comefrom: only one of his seven persecutors could write."Dove Thurbey," he said to himself. "Dove Thurbey, Dick Abrystowe, Luggins Cadwallader, Mog Glendower, Follentine Hylles, Soth Gard, and Hwfa Morgan. They'll all be waiting, and they'll have stones and stakes and broken bottles. What had I better do?"He simply did not know.He could probably run faster than any of the seven, but he could not escape from a hail of cobblestones, and his chief dread was that his spectacles should be broken, for he possessed only one pair, and there was no means of repairing them. He was not a coward but he knew, too, that once Dove, Dick, Luggins, Mog, Follentine, Soth and Hwfa had him down there would be little hope for him. They wore metal-tipped clogs and they were all twice his size--Hwfa was nearly six foot--and big and brawny. Mog was going to work next month, Dick, Dove, and Luggins played in the town football team. The seven of them sat together at the back of the school and paid no heed to Mr. Price, who had long ago given up trying to teach them.Nor was there much chance of aid. The citizens of Pennygaff were all snug in their kitchens by now, with doors and windows shut; if they heard a sound of fighting they were more likely to pull the curtains tighter than to leave their firesides in defence of an outsider. Wild boars from the forest were known to come into the streets after dark, and wild men too, on occasion; it was very seldom that the townspeople left their homes after nightfall except in compact groups.While he was thinking these gloomy thoughts Owen heard, with surprise, the sound of running footsteps. Hisheart jolted with anxiety, hope, suspense. Could the runner be a possible ally? He could tell that it was not one of his enemies--the steps were too light and much too fast.A man came into view, bolting at top speed down the mountain road. As he approached Owen saw, first, that he wore some sort of livery; next, that he was a stranger. He grasped a staff in his right hand. But here was no ally, Owen realized with sinking hope--this man was in the last extremity of haste and exhaustion. His legs would hardly have carried him had not the way lain downhill. As it was, they fled weakly along and he followed them, only half aware, it seemed, of where they were taking him.As he neared Owen, words fell from him in a clot:"SisplacePennygaff?""Yes!" Owen called back. "--Sir!"But already the runner was past, careering down the hill into the darkness below, as if all the wolves of the Black Mountains were at his heels.Down in the valley the town clock tolled six times.Owen knew that in the next few moments he must come to a decision.He had left his schoolbooks and coat under a loose board in the classroom--a hiding-place which, fortunately, had so far gone undiscovered. A coat would only hinder flight and give his pursuers something to catch hold of, while the books belonged to his grandfather and were precious with age and use. Owen could hardly imagine what his punishment would be if any harm came to them. Besides, he loved books for their own sake, and hated the thought of their being torn apart and dashed on the muddy cobbles.What was that sound?He turned quickly, just in time to see a black shadow dart from one point of concealment to another. He caught a whisper, and a brutal chuckle.They were closing in.There was no second way out of the school, which stood enclosed by iron railings, higher up the mountain than any other building on that side of Pennygaff. To reach home, Owen was obliged to descend the steep winding hill through the town, cross the single bridge over the river Gaff, and climb an equally steep hill on the other side. Even supposing he could outdistance his enemies as far as the bridge, he could hardly keep ahead of them up the farther hill; some of them would almost certainly be posted on the bridge, waiting for him.Now a second figure dashed across the road, apelike and crouching; he recognized Mog. And to his left Owen heard the sound of a throat being cleared, deliberately, mocking and shrill; that was Hwfa, who, despite his size, still sang treble in the chapel choir."Well now, boys," whispered another voice--that was Luggins--"if the snivelling little dummer won't come out, go in and get him we must!"Searching his pockets for anything that might serve as a weapon, Owen found a small heavy worsted bag. He ran his fingers over it in bewilderment; what could it be? Then he recollected that his grandfather had bidden him go during his dinner hour and collect a couple of items that had been omitted from the weekly order sent up by old Mrs. Evans the grocery. Soap and something else--perhapswhatever it was would serve to delay his attackers for a moment--Just then both parties were checked by a new sound, the clipclop of hoofs and carriage wheels rattling over the uneven roadway. Next moment a chaise came briskly round the corner above the school and drew to a halt beside the gates, its single lamp shining on Owen's face."Hey, you--you there, you boy!" The driver's voice startled Owen by its loud, harsh, resonant tones. A tall man, swathed in many capes, waved a whip at him commandingly. The deep brim of his beaver hat shaded his face from Owen's view."Y-yes, sir," he stammered. "Can I help you?""Is this dismal place the town of Pennygaff?""Yes, sir.""Thank God for that, at least. I've been traversing these hideous black hills for the best part of three hours--I wish to heaven I may never have to set foot here again! Well then, can you direct me to the museum--though, by Beelzebub, if ever there was a piece of arrant impudence, it is for a pre-historic settlement like this to possess such a thing? Place should be on show itself as a savage relic.""Down the hill, sir, across the bridge, and up the other side. You'll see it on your right, above the Habakkuk chapel," said Owen, rather indignant at this slight on the town of his ancestors, and surprised, too. What could this stranger want with the museum, at such an hour?"Any decent inns here?" the man demanded."There's one inn, sir--the Dragon of Gwaun, by the bridge.""One--is that all? How far is this desolate spot from Caer Malyn?""A matter of twenty mile, sir.""Perdition! The mare'll never do it, she's dead lame. I fear I must resign myself to pass the night at the inn." The driver was about to touch up his horses when he paused again, and said in a careless, offhand manner,"Do you know, boy, if a pair of ruffianly rogues of English peddlers have come to this hamlet recently--a tall man and a short one? Bilk and Prigman, I believe they call themselves.""Why--why, yes, sir," Owen said, pondering, "I do believe such a pair has been about. You might hear tell of them at the inn.""Humph! Very probably! Come up, then, mare!"The chaise clattered on without a word of thanks from its driver, leaving Owen ready to curse himself for his folly at letting slip such a chance of escape. Why had he not offered to accompany the man and show him the way to the museum? Nothing could have been more natural. But there had been something about the stranger's harsh voice and cold, half-angry bearing that made Owen discard the notion as soon as it entered his head; this was not a man likely to grant favours.Almost before the sound of hoofs had faded down the hill, Owen's attackers were closing in once more. Only three of them, though. It seemed that he had guessed right; Soth, Dick, Follentine, and Dove were waiting down at the bridge to cut off his escape.Well, he would sell his life dear.He pulled the cloth bag from his pocket and, delving inside, extracted a twist of paper."Go on, Hwfa, man! Pound the little flamer!" whispered Mog.As the three of them edged towards him Owen, suddenly taking the initiative, darted forward and shot the contents of the packet full into Hwfa's face.It was snuff. Nothing could have been more unexpected, or more successful. Stopping short with a gasp of pain, Hwfa rubbed and rubbed at his eyes, cursing and blubbering."Wait till I get at you, will you! Oh dammo, my eyes. Have the head off him, Mog!"But Owen had not waited. Darting past Hwfa he doubled round Luggins and Mog while they were still taken by surprise, and was off like lightning down the hill. In a moment, though, he heard them coming after him. A cobblestone whistled past his ears. He had very little start.Halfway down, the road from Hereford came in on the left. As he crossed the turning, Owen was obliged to swerve in order to avoid a hooded wagon which swung out of the side road and turned downhill towards the bridge. Grabbing, to steady himself, at the shaft, which had passed within six inches of his shoulder, Owen glanced up at the driver in apology."I'm sorry, sir," he panted, and then, in utter astonishment, "Why--<i>Mr. Dando!</i>""Eh? What's that? Who? Where?" The man on the box peered down at him absently. "Dando's my name sure enough, but do I know you? Face seems familiar, certainly--but then, so many faces do--all faces much alike,I am thinking? Still, yours--yes, seen it before somewhere, I do feel I have. But where, now?""Don't you remember? You took me up in the port of Southampton last summer when I was starting out to walk to Wales and carried me as far as Gloucester--surely you recall?"Mr. Dando was still rubbing a hand through his long dark locks, making them stand on end, while he muttered, "Perhaps--perhaps--" when he was interrupted by the three pursuers, who arrived with a clatter of clogs and hurled themselves on Owen. For a moment, all was confusion. Owen fought desperately, but his feet were knocked from under him and he was being borne to the ground when a girl in a red dress put her head out at the back of the wagon."What is it, Father? What is happening? Why--<i>Owen</i>!"Big clumsy Mog, hindered temporarily from his assault by the bodies of his two allies, looked up at the girl on the wagon and gaped in astonishment at what he saw. Her dark hair was piled on top of her head in a knob, or coronet, and perched upon this, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, was a large black-and-white bird, with a curved roman bill.When the girl saw what was happening she exclaimed, "Scatter them, Hawc!" in a voice that carried like a bell.Instantly the great bird launched himself off her head, rose, circled a couple of times high over the combatants, and then hurtled down on them in a whistling dive. He landed with a thump, striking his razor-sharp talons into the jacket of Hwfa, who gave a shrill yell and ran for his life. The falcon loosed him, at another command from thegirl, and returned to pounce on Luggins, scoring a set of deep parallel tracks through his tow-coloured hair. Completely terrified at this unexpected pain and the fierce clutching weight on his head, Luggins let go of Owen, whom he was slowly throttling, and tried to shake off the falcon. Mog, seeing the battle was lost, had already made his escape.Luggins stumbled after him, calling out desperately,"Mog! Mog! Don't leave me! Get this brute off me, boy!Mog made not the slightest effort to help, but at another whistle from his mistress Hawc released the punishing grip on Luggins's scalp and came oaring back through the rainy night, to take up his perch once more on the girl's crown of hair.She had jumped off the wagon and was hugging Owen, who could hardly believe his eyes."Arabis! What are you and your father doing in these parts?""Owen, are you all right?""Yes, they had hardly started on me--thanks to Hawc!" He settled his glasses--which were dangling from one ear but miraculously unbroken--back on his nose. "But how do you come to be here?""I asked Dada to come through by Pennygaff on purpose so that there would be a chance of seeing you, maybe. On our way to the fair at Devil's Leap--Nant Agerddau, we are. But how is it with you, Owen bach? Dear to goodness, how you've grown! Taller than me, now! Did you find your grandfather all right? Are you happy, with you? Who were those brutes?""Boys from my school.""Fine sort of school! Why were they after you?""Oh, just because I am a stranger here."Owen glanced down the hill. His enemies had dispersed. For the moment, at least, he was saved."There's silly, and your father and granda born here. Gracious, how it rains! Come inside the wagon, Galahad won't mind another in the load, will he, Dada? I'm sure Owen doesn't weigh any more than he did last summer--thin as a withy he is, still.""Galahad? He could haul half the mountain and never notice. Fresh as a daisy, aren't you, my little one?" Mr. Dando clucked to the horse--who was indeed of massive build--and shook up the re...</p><h2>Coup d&#39;Etat in America: The CIA and the Assassination of John F.

Part 1 describes what makes some democracies so violent, why current explanations are wanting, and why common &#x201c;solutions&#x201d; backfire. Part 2, which makes up the bulk of the book, describes the steps that successful democracies followed to achieve greater security. Each country&#x2019;s story is woven throughout the chapters, because their steps are not linear. Nearly every democracy must take measures that appear to lead backward in order to progress, just as hikers must often descend into a canyon to eventually reach a summit. Upward momentum is not inevitable. Societies lurch forward, then make mistakes and fall back into new pathologies. Part 3 discusses the implications of this new way of understanding violence and what governments, businesses, philanthropists, and regular people can do to help.<br><br>Five ideas serve as guides. <br><br>1. Violence as a Governing Strategy: Democracies become engulfed by violence in two situations. As common wisdom suggests, one cause is when states are too weak to enforce order. The second arises when politicians abdicate the monopoly of force and collude with violent groups to maintain power. The latter situation I call Privilege Violence because it occurs in highly unequal, politically polarized societies governed by political and economic elites who twist the law to their benefit to monopolize exorbitant state resources. This idea is new, and so it has never before been the focus of policy. Yet complicit states are far more common than those that are merely weak, and require a different solution. <br><br>2. Societies Decivilize and Recivilize: Ubiquitous violence changes society. Even in Mafia-riddled Sicily and insurgent-scarred Colom�bia, organized gangs, professional criminals, militias, and guerril�las accounted for only a portion of the bloodshed. Ordinary people contributed, too. When people lose trust in their government and antagonism deepens toward fellow citizens, violence increases, and impunity grows. Ordinary people&#x2019;s inhibitions to using force fall. Businessmen murder rivals; neighbors extort neighbors. As predatory elites allow violence to rise, societies polarize into two camps: those who seek a return to law and order even at the cost of government repression, and those who demand a more just government. In each faction, most people simply become apolo�gists for the violence emanating from &#x201c;their&#x201d; side. But some join gangs claiming to protect their neighborhoods, support guerril�las, or donate to paramilitaries. This is called the &#x201c;decivilizing pro�cess,&#x201d; and it can happen in any culture, from Bloody Kansas on the eve of the U.S. Civil War, to Michoac�n, Mexico. These places look pathological. But any society can decivilize when governments abandon ordinary people to fend for themselves. <br><br>3. The Middle Class Is the Fulcrum of Change: Policy makers fighting violence tend to focus solutions on perpetrators or victims. They propose peace treaties with rebels or suggest grassroots pro�grams to deter people from joining gangs or terrorist groups. Yet Privilege Violence is rooted in the way a state is governed. Change begins when the middle class, the people with enough voice and power to change the system, mobilize. In these democracies, politicians depend on the middle class for votes and ensure that they are rarely touched by violence. In highly unequal societies, the lives of those shattered by murder are so remote from most middle-class families that the problem can be ignored for a long time. The middle class rouses only when its sense of invulnerability breaks. Then whether they organize to change the system perpetuating violence or double down by supporting repression determines whether a country takes a step toward security or deepens its dev�astation. It takes social leaders to organize the middle class into movements that are focused on effective goals, strong enough to overcome entrenched interests, and broad and nonpartisan enough to achieve success in highly polarized countries. <br><br>4. Governments Need Dirty Deals, Centralization, and Surveillance: Countries that have fallen prey to Privilege Violence have bureaucrats and politicians who are helping criminals and insurgents. To fight this enemy within, politicians must centralize power and use dangerous tools such as surveillance and asset seizure. When a state&#x2019;s police, military, and courts have been hollowed out by corruption and criminality, pragmatic leaders must make peace treaties and offer amnesties to the worst violent groups to buy the bureaucracy time to repair. Those agreements are essential, but they also make the job of rebuilding a just and trustworthy state more difficult. A skilled politician can wield these tools without becoming authoritarian. But often the scalpel slips. Politicians lauded as reformers become more dictatorial. Societies must choose whether to allow their countries to descend into authoritarianism or rise up again and demand that their newspapers report the truth, their courts convict government wrongdoers, and their police walk the thin, difficult line of justice. <br>&nbsp;<br>5. States and Societies Recivilize Together: Like the sand and the sea, states and societies function in tight relationship. Societies decivilize when states abandon the monopoly on violence. They recivilize when people decide to trust one another and follow the law. Yet communities cannot start that process alone. Reform-minded politicians must first prove that the state is governing for all of its people and enforcing the laws equally. But in a broken state, political leaders have few tools to start this process. It takes savvy politicians using all their political skills to get the state work�ing before a government has a strong bureaucracy and security services. Throughout the process of descent and rebirth, states and societies pass the baton back and forth, spurring each other toward vicious cycles of increasing violence or virtuous cycles of renewal.</p><h2>A Little House of Their Own (Little House Prequel)</h2><p><p>The Little House books have captivated millions of readers with their story of Laura Ingalls, a pioneer girl growing up on the Americanfrontier.

Bennis's hostess, Margaret Anson, presents an icy version of the grieving mother, cut out her late husband's will--until now. And when Gregor Demarkian, ex-FBI man and Bennis's lover, arrives from Philadelphia to consult with local police, a media blitz storms in as more suspects crawl out of the woods. Kayla may have been too blindingly rich for her wild, private school chum; her older, socially ambitious entrepreneur boyfriend; and a divorced, downsized bookeeper selling her furniture to survive. As Gregor maps out distances, location, and motives, Halloween descends on the dark, silent hills. From a skeleton sprawled on the cemetery caretakers' porch to more deadly mischief and mayhem, the countryside is brimming with secrets. And a killer is about to strike again...<br></p><p>Jane Haddam is the author of numerous articles and books including sixteen previous mysteries featuring Gregor Demarkian. She lives with her two sons in Litchfield County, Connecticut.<br>In Haddam's 15th entry in her entertaining Gregor Demarkian series (Deadly Beloved, etc.), Bennis Hannaford discovers the murdered body of debutante heiress Kayla Anson during a Halloween visit to the Anson estate in a posh area of Connecticut. Bennis summons her lover, Gregor, retired head of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, from Philadelphia to help the local police. These logistics out of the way, Haddam settles into another clever plot-driven village cozy. Two more people are murdered: publicity-hungry Zara Anne Moss, who said she saw the killer, and Margaret Anson, Kayla's vengeful, money-hungry mother. Gregor studies area maps and interviews locals to separate clues from elaborate red herrings: a telephone pole knocked over, a stolen Jeep smashed in the Fairchild Family Cemetery and a skeleton from a nearby museum left on the caretakers' porch. Haddam excels at showing the chilling gulf between the arrogant wealthy and the climbers desperate to join them. One of her most complex characters is penniless divorc?e Sally Martindale. Humiliated by her bookkeeping job at the exclusive Swamp Tree Country Club, Sally embezzles from members' accounts, foolishly hoping that a gambling win will restore her status among club members. In an anomalous subplot, Bennis is stricken with pneumonia and Gregor insists that she stop smoking. Haddam's well-meaning message about the perils of tobacco seems shoehorned into an otherwise smoothly running mystery marked by lively characters, good descriptions and enough misdirection to keep a reader's interest high.

His stories are at once timeless and of-the-moment, and his themes are universal: love, language, ambition, power, corruption, religion, family, identity.

Hamid now resides in Lahore, his birthplace, after living for a number of years in New York and London.Art and the Other Pakistans<br>(The Ones That Don&#x2019;t Make the Headlines)<br><br>Looking back, it&#x2019;s obvious to me now that the Pakistan of my teens was bursting with art. I had a burly cousin who used to play (incongruously) with inks and watercolors in the afternoons when he got home from school. I had an aunt who was in the habit of telling over and over again the story of her random encounter with the famous artist Sadequain, an encounter that resulted in him executing what was surely his version of an autograph: a quick drawing depicting my aunt as a Nefertiti-necked goddess holding a flower above a line of calligraphy. I had seen the legendary painter Chughtai&#x2019;s long-eyed ladies smiling out from drawing room walls, offering half-lidded innuendoes to easily flustered young men like me. And I had in the backdrop of my youth the Lahore Museum, the marvelous old city, the trucks and cinema billboards covered in bold, pelvis-thrusting iconography.<br><br>But at the time, art felt to me like something that belonged either to the past or to other places, because my teens were in the 1980s, and Pakistan in the 1980s had the misfortune of being governed by a mustachioed dictator with dark bags under his eyes and a fondness for dystopian social reengineering. General Zia-ul-Haq claimed to be acting in the name of Islam, and even though the history of Islam in our part of the world stretched back over a thousand years, we were told that our Islam wasn&#x2019;t Islamic enough, indeed that we Muslims weren&#x2019;t Muslim enough, and that he would make of our Pakistan the &#x201c;land of the pure&#x201d; that its name suggested&#x2014;or ruin us all trying.<br><br>Under Zia, flogging, amputation, and stoning to death became statutory punishments. Acts disrespectful to symbols of Islam were criminalized. Public performances of dance by women were banned. News in Arabic, the language of the Koran but spoken by virtually no one in Pakistan, was given a prime-time slot on television. Thugs belonging to the student wings of religious parties seized control of many college campuses. Heroin and assault rifles flooded the streets, &#x201c;blowback&#x201d; from Pakistan&#x2019;s alliance with the United States against the Soviets in Afghanistan. My parents reminisced about how much more liberal Lahore had been in their youth.<br><br>When General Zia was blown to bits shortly after my seventeenth birthday in 1988, he wasn&#x2019;t mourned, at least not by anyone I knew. I left for college in the United States a year later. There I met people who were studying photography and sculpture, and I myself enrolled in classes on creative writing. Without thinking about it, I supposed an education in these &#x201c;artistic&#x201d; pursuits was something in which only affluent societies in the West could afford to invest, or, rather, that only the twin luxuries of material success and tolerance of free expression could provide the sort of soil in which an artistic education could thrive.<br><br>I was, of course, completely wrong. When I returned to Pakistan in 1993, I was working on what would become my first novel. I thought of writing as a transgressive act. I wrote at night, often from midnight to dawn, and in between writing sessions I would escape into the darkness with my friends. We drove around town in old Japanese cars, hung out on our rooftops, and searched for places beyond the reach of societal control or parental observation. Cheap local booze and even cheaper slabs of hash were the intoxicants of choice in that young urban scene, and avoiding the predations of the bribe-taking police was an alarming and amusing preoccupation.<br><br>Increasingly I found my wanderings taking me into the world of the National College of Arts. A couple of my friends were enrolled there, one studying architecture, another graphic design. Others were dating students: painters, printmakers. It was unlike anything I had ever seen. Students of all social classes, and from all parts of Pakistan, attended NCA. The place was a microcosm of Pakistan, but of a creative Pakistan, an alternative to the desiccated Pakistan General Zia had tried to ram down our throats. Here people who prayed five times a day and people who escaped from their hostels late at night to disappear on sexual adventures in the city could coexist. In the studios I saw calligraphy and nudes, work by students with purely formal concerns, and by others for whom art overlapped with politics. I was inspired. I wrote like crazy. I made friends I have kept for life.<br><br>Love comes to mind when I think of that time. There was a lot of it going on among the people I hung out with. But I was also falling in love with Pakistan. I have always had a stubborn affection for the land of my birth. When I went abroad for college, I thought I knew it pretty well. But it was my encounters with the denizens of the NCA universe after my return that reminded me that Pakistan is too vast a country to be known, that it is full of surprises, of kinks and twists, of unexpected titillations and empathic connections, of a diversity that can only be described as human. It was exciting and vital and real.<br><br>Or rather, they were exciting and vital and real&#x2014;for my Pakistan had become plural. The art, and artists, I found at NCA ushered me into many more Pakistans: the nascent underground music scenes, the emerging film and television scenes, the scenes of writers like myself, and of course the scenes of other art and other artists, not just in Lahore but in Karachi and Islamabad and elsewhere, and not just in 1993 but in the rest of the nineties, the noughties, and now.<br><br>Just a few months ago I was in Amsterdam with two old friends from the Lahore art world. On a warm summer night we checked out some galleries and walked along the canals, whirring bicycles and shrooming teenagers passing us in the darkness. Nothing could have been more different from where we had all been fifteen years earlier. And nothing could have been more similar, either.<br><br>(2009)</p><h2>In the Shadow of the Shaman: Connecting with Self, Nature &amp; Spirit (Llewellyn's New Worlds Spirituality Series)</h2><p><p>Blending ancient shamanistic wisdom with modern spiritual traditions, Amber Wolfe helps readers forge their own personal connection to shamanic worlds. This guide to shamanism&#x2015;filled with examples of guided journeys, secrets of shamanic divination, visualization techniques, healing practices, spells, rituals, and recipes&#x2015;provides all one needs to begin dancing in the shadow of the shaman.</p></p><p>Over the past several years, shamanism has been increasing in popularity. It is the oldest spiritual system known, and it is still vital and powerful. The truth, however, is that to really learn shamanism you must develop your own contacts with your personal spirit helpers and guides. To learn this you should get<i> In the Shadow of the Shaman</i> by Amber Wolfe. <br> <br>This book is a complete and unique course in shamanism. By giving you numerous journeys or vision quests to attempt, you end up finding your own helpers, guides, guardians, and other spirit entities. Most important is that inner guide with knowledge of everything you need to dance in the shadow of the shaman. <br> <br>But that does not mean your guide is going to give you long lectures. Rather, you will be led to find the wisdom you need. In order to do that you must have a great deal of information available to you. Some of this is simply wisdom you have already acquired. This book fills that out with shamanic techniques; such as methods of interpreting the meaning of stones by their shape and color; using herbs, stones and energy for healing; and various methods of divination. <br> <br>The design of this book allows you to pick and choose what is valuable to you. Combine that with past knowledge and other information from your inner guide and you simply can't miss! <br> <br>A friend once told me that ultimately, all magick is personal magick. Whether you seek magick, healing, divination, or a deeper relationship to nature and the gods, <i>In the Shadow of the Shaman </i>will show you the path to learn what you seek. And then you will be able to have the ultimate spiritual system which is right for you. <br><p>Amber Wolfe is a master-level educator and psychotherapist in private practice. She follows an American Shamanic path, using the wisdoms found in the Celtic forms of Craft, Church, and myth that are her heritage. She also honors the sacred teachings of Native American medicine elders who have shared their knowledge of the nature of this land.</p> <p>Amber Wolfe calls herself a Ban Drui, a term that has several meanings. Among them are Wise Woman, Druidess, White Oak Woman, and (as described by William Butler Yeats) a "Faerie Doctor." These titles represent her style as a writer, teacher, and therapist, whose work emphasizes the magick qualities of self-transformation and personal evolution.</p></p><h2>THE DICTIONARY OF POPULAR YIDDISH WORDS, PHRASES,</h2><p>For both students of Yiddish and students of humanity.

Her beloved characters--Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddle-Duck, and their whimsical friends--were inspired by the English countryside, which she grew to love during summer vacations as a girl. In 1905, at the age of 40, Potter bought Hill Top Farm overlooking Esthwaite Water in the Lake District, a region of hills and lakes famous for its glorious landscapes. She continued to buy property in the area with her royalties, and by the time she died 37 years later, she had amassed over 4,000 acres. She fought vigorously to preserve the beauty of the Lake District and its rural ways, leaving her estate to the National Trust, Britain's leading conservation agency. This book, written by an official of the Trust, is a tribute to the jewel of the estate, 17th-century Hill Top Farm. Potter restored and furnished it as a showcase of English country ways, though she actually lived in a large cottage nearby. Her substantial collection of Lake District antiques reflected the influential Arts &amp; Crafts movement, which emphasized the integrity of handmade objects in a period of increasing mechanization. The book takes us on a tour of the farm, alternating the artist's original photographs and watercolors with photographs of the building and countryside as they look today. Several two-page spreads of the garden in early summer and the Lake District in late autumn are especially beautiful. Unpretentious, solid, charming, understated: <i>At Home with Beatrix Potter</i> embodies the rustic virtues that Beatrix loved. <i>--John Stevenson</i>Susan Denyer, who has lived in England's Lake District for many years, works for Britain's National Trust. Her publications include <i>Beatrix Potter and Her Farms, Lake District Landscapes</i>, and <i>A Century in the Lake District</i>.</p><h2>Sword of the Spirit, Shield of Faith: Religion in American War and Diplomacy</h2><p>A richly detailed, profoundly engrossing story of how religion has influenced American foreign relations, told through the stories of the men and women&#x2014;from presidents to preachers&#x2014;who have plotted the country&#x2019;s course in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ever since John Winthrop argued that the Puritans&#x2019; new home would be &#x201c;a city upon a hill,&#x201d; Americans&#x2019; role in the world has been shaped by their belief that God has something special in mind for them. But this is a story that historians have mostly ignored. Now, in the first authoritative work on the subject, Andrew Preston explores the major strains of religious fervor&#x2014;liberal and conservative, pacifist and militant, internationalist and isolationist&#x2014;that framed American thinking on international issues from the earliest colonial wars to the twenty-first century. He arrives at some startling conclusions, among them: Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s use of religion in the Civil War became the model for subsequent wars of humanitarian intervention; nineteenth-century Protestant missionaries made up the first NGO to advance a global human rights agenda; religious liberty was the centerpiece of Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s strategy to bring the United States into World War II.<br> &nbsp;<br> From George Washington to George W. Bush, from the Puritans to the present, from the colonial wars to the Cold War, religion has been one of America&#x2019;s most powerful sources of ideas about the wider world. When, just days after 9/11, George W. Bush described America as &#x201c;a prayerful nation, a nation that prays to an almighty God for protection and for peace,&#x201d; or when Barack Obama spoke of balancing the &#x201c;just war and the imperatives of a just peace&#x201d; in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech, they were echoing four hundred years of religious rhetoric. Preston traces this echo back to its source.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Sword of the Spirit, Shield of Faith</i> is an unprecedented achievement: no one has yet attempted such a bold synthesis of American history. It is also a remarkable work of balance and fair-mindedness about one of the most fraught subjects in America.</p><p>ANDREW PRESTON teaches American history and international relations history at Cambridge University, where he is a fellow of Clare College. Before Cambridge, he taught history and international studies at Yale University. He has also taught at universities in Canada and Switzerland, and has been a fellow at the Cold War Studies Program at the London School of Economics. He is the author of <i>The War Council: McGeorge Bundy, the NSC, and Vietnam</i>.Introduction<br><br>Sword of the Spirit, <i>Shield of Fait</i>h was written under the assumption that religion played an important role in shaping American percep- tions of the world and in contributing to domestic debates on how the United States should engage with other nations. It is an exploration not of<i> whether</i> religion influenced U.S. foreign relations, but <i>how.</i> It is a logical assumption: few would argue that religion has not played a consistently important role in American life, for better or worse.<br><br>This last qualifier&#x2014;for better or worse&#x2014;is important, for this book also operates under the assumption that religion is just like any other his- torical topic. It is not my desire, and certainly not my intention, to make a case either for or against a role for religion in public life. Readers will of course use the material in this book to support their own beliefs that religion is either a productive or a pernicious force in American foreign relations. Partisans on both sides of the acrimonious debate over religion&#x2019;s place in the public square&#x2014;and increasingly over the nature of religion itself&#x2014;will find plenty of evidence to back up their competing claims. But such quarrels are not my concern. Religion provokes intense emotions, and no historian is free of bias. Nonetheless, I have sought to treat my subject as objectively as possible.<br><br>Doing so has meant recognizing that there was not one religious influence upon American foreign relations, but many: nationalist but also inter- nationalist, exceptionalist but also cosmopolitan, nativist but also tolerant, militant but also pacifist. The religious influence was neither monolithic nor consensual but a product of intense dialogue, debate, and controversy. Nor did it always push U.S. foreign policy in the same direction. It is a fascinatingly complex story, but its very complexity makes its unraveling all the more important and worthwhile.<br>BUT WHY FOCUS on religion at all? Why does it matter to American diplomatic history? Aside from the personal faith of individual policymakers, religion has been integral to American politics and culture, and to Ameri- ca&#x2019;s sense of itself, and thus also to the products of politics and culture, such as foreign policy. More specifically, religion has had an almost uniquely intimate relationship with American war and diplomacy. In times of war, religious liberals and conservatives, militants and pacifists, have all called upon God to sanctify their cause, and all have viewed America as God&#x2019;s chosen land. As a result, U.S. foreign policy has often acquired the tenor of a moral crusade.<br><br>Moreover, the religious mindset was geographically limitless; those who possessed it were concerned not only with their community, state, or country, but the entire world. As immigrants, generations of Ameri- can Christians, Jews, and Muslims thought of themselves as members of a transnational faith that transcended national boundaries. They kept in reg- ular contact with coreligionists overseas and followed the political affairs in foreign countries that affected these spiritual kinfolk. They sought to spread the gospel to people who had never heard of Christ and endured incredible hardship in doing so. They were more likely to live and travel abroad and more likely to have a foreign correspondent. Unlike most of their fellow citizens, then, religious Americans inherently thought of themselves as citizens of the world. They paid closer attention to foreign affairs and were more likely to allow international developments to affect their political views. Thus while religious faith helped create an American nationalism, it also fostered a powerful sense of internationalism.<br><br>Since the late sixteenth century, long before the United States existed, religion has played an important role in shaping Americans&#x2019; perceptions of the wider world. In both popular debates about American engagement with the world and the foreign policies that have emerged from these debates, religion has been a major factor. The religious influence&#x2014;indeed, religious faith itself&#x2014;has not always been strong or consistent. But though it has ebbed and flowed, it has always been there.<br><br>This seems to be a basic point&#x2014;religion matters, and always has&#x2014;yet it is an important one to make because it has been so neglected in explain- ing the history of American war and diplomacy. Historians have empha- sized a wide array of factors, from traditional concerns such as economics, national security, and military strategy, to newer theories based on race, gender, culture, and postmodernism. All are important grounds for inquiry, and all have yielded a rich understanding of the American past. Yet until very recently, religion was seen as a mystifying sideshow, an irrational impulse born of a &#x201c;paranoid style&#x201d; that clouded the realist assumptions of high diplomacy. Even after diplomatic history&#x2019;s cultural turn&#x2014;an exciting development over the past two decades that has pushed scholars to incor- porate race, class, and gender into the American diplomatic tradition&#x2014;and its international turn, which portrays the United States as &#x201c;a nation among nations,&#x201d; religion remains peripheral or nonexistent. This is true for oth- erwise superb overviews of U.S. foreign policy that purport to examine American &#x201c;ideals,&#x201d; &#x201c;style,&#x201d; &#x201c;ideology,&#x201d; &#x201c;mission,&#x201d; &#x201c;Wilsonian idealism,&#x201d; &#x201c;core values,&#x201d; even &#x201c;why America fights&#x201d;&#x2014;normative topics, in other words, that are ideally suited to religious ideas and values and incomplete without them. In fact, until very recently religion was sidelined in most fields of modern American history. Be it the history of politics, immigration, or civil rights, religious faith was pushed to the margins when it made any appearance at all. It seemed that only historians of American religion took religion seriously, an absurd situation when one considers the prevalence and importance of religion in American life.1<br><br>Sword of the Spirit, Shield of Faith aims to help fill this gap in our understanding of how Americans have engaged the wider world. It pre- sents a new survey of the history of American foreign relations, told pre- dominantly through a religious lens. Readers should remember that this is not a new master narrative of U.S. foreign policy but a new perspective that aims to complement and enrich existing interpretations without necessarily replacing them. I have begun my story at the onset of England&#x2019;s settlement of North America in the late sixteenth century and ended it with a brief look at the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama in the early twenty-first. My chronological scope should not be taken as an argument for the essential continuity of an unchanging history, yet there has been continuity: time and again, many of the same themes appear and reappear down the years.<br><br>Many of these themes&#x2014;cultural habits that informed the making of policy&#x2014;originated in the colonial period and then crystallized in later years. To say that this book is an examination of U.S. foreign policy is to elide the fact that our story begins before there was a United States that could even have a foreign policy. But the colonial era was crucial, a period in which many of the premises of an American worldview were established and developed. To begin in 1776 or 1783 or 1789, then, is to join the story after it has already begun. Many other syntheses of U.S. foreign relations do precisely this, and while they have much to offer they miss much that is vital in the formative years. Ignoring the colonial period in an otherwise comprehensive overview assumes that habits and ideas began anew with the creation of the United States of America, when we know that this was impossible.<br>Yet while the earliest eras of American history matter greatly, they do not, in the history of American foreign policy or international relations more generally, matter nearly as much as more recent periods. Of the four centuries since Europeans crossed the Atlantic to settle the eastern shore of North America, it was only in the last hundred years that Amer- ica became a great power of truly world historical importance. As late as the 1880s, the United States was little more than a minnow in the diplo- matic ocean; from then on, it grew steadily to become one of the largest whales the world has ever seen. For this reason, I pay more attention to the period since the United States announced itself on the global stage by routing Spain in the war of 1898. Not coincidentally, this also marked the period when American religion became more pluralistic, more compli- cated, and more diffuse.2<br><br>To uncover the habits and ideas that gave shape to America&#x2019;s interac- tions with the wider world, I focus not only on the traditional aspects of diplomatic history&#x2014;elites in closed rooms conducting national security policy in secret&#x2014;but also on the popular pressures brought to bear upon diplomats and policymakers. This book is a study of how religion shaped America&#x2019;s engagement with the wider world, including the overseas efforts of private citizens, missionaries, and other nongovernmental organizations, in addition to the use of diplomatic and military power. It is not just about U.S. foreign <i>policy</i>, then, but U.S. foreign<i> relations</i>. The distinction is critical: the former term examines only the formulation and execution of actual government policy, while the latter includes policy but also a wider array of American interactions with the world, from missionaries to voluntarist and philanthropic initiatives to corporate and economic interests. The only way to capture the richness of the religious influence&#x2014;and to find it where it would otherwise remain hidden&#x2014;is to blend &#x201c;high&#x201d; and &#x201c;low&#x201d; versions of history, from the top-down perspective of policymaking elites to the bottom-up view of religious Americans who do not...</p><h2>British Army Cap Badges of the First World War (Shire Collections)</h2><p>The fascination with the British involvement in the First World War extends to all aspects of the conflict. The battles and their outcomes; the armies and their leaders; the conditions of trench warfare; and the controversies form part of the growing literature examining every aspect of a war that was to cast a shadow over the rest of the twentieth century, the effects of which are still being felt today. <br><br>For the British army, the cap badge is the most easily identifiable form of insignia. It represents a distillation of the pride of the regiment, its various battle honors and symbols borne proudly on the metallic emblem that was worn on all headdress, even within the trenches. Identification of the cap badge on old photographs is a first, important step in unraveling the military service of an individual. <br><br>Cap badges have been collected avidly since they were first thought of in the nineteenth century. Cap-badge collecting is as popular now as it has ever been; yet with a growing number of fakes and forgeries, there is a need for a book that illustrates clearly the main types, and allows the collector and family historian alike to understand their meaning. <br><br>Surprisingly, there are no real comprehensive web-based resources; and the available books (many of which are out of print), are often dull, arcane and poorly illustrated with grey, muddy images of otherwise spectacular badges.<br><br>This book illustrates, for the first time in full color and high quality, images of the main types of badges used by the British Army in World War I. In addition, contemporary illustrations of the soldiers themselves wearing the badges, and the wider importance of their symbolism, is also included. Employing the skills of an established writer (and collector) and artist, it provides a unique reference guide for all people interested in the World War I.</p><p>Peter Doyle is a scientist, military historian, and author.

And, I must admit, I've was somewhat skeptical of Sheldrake's previous books on "morphic resonance". <p> But being an open-minded person, I am glad when I can change my mind, and I am glad to report that this is a worthy book--because of its practicality. Sheldrake confronts some of the outstanding questions facing "PSIence"--and proposes level-headed experiments that readers themselves can become engaged in. Science has often made its greatest advances not when areas of the unknown were summarily dismissed--but when a proper balance between paradigm shifts and experimentation fell into place. It is conceivable that books such as this may help with the evolution of PSI to science.</p>NEW SCIENCE <br> <br>&#x201c;In any generation, there are only a handful of people whose ideas contain the possibility of significantly altering the course of human history. Dr. Rupert Sheldrake is such a person. His ideas offer a real chance for humanity to regain its spiritual bearings. We have been blessed with a rare genius.&#x201d; <br>--Larry Dossey, M.D., bestselling author of <em>Healing Words</em> <br> <br>How does your pet know when you are coming home? How do pigeons home? Can people really feel another pair of eyes looking at them? These questions and other unexplained natural phenomena form the basis of Sheldrake&#x2019;s look at the world of established science as he puts some of its most cherished assumptions to the test. He shows how fundamental scientific theories have hardened into unquestioned dogmas and are now taken for granted as scientific common sense. In the true spirit of scientific skepticism, Sheldrake examines seven of these beliefs. <br> <br>His approach is radical in two senses: not only does he question the content of current scientific doctrines, but he also questions the way that science is done. He suggests that scientific inquiry need no longer be the monopoly of a professional scientific priesthood but can be open to widespread participation by students and by nonprofessionals. Sheldrake presents experiments that allow anyone to participate in this journey of discovery and, in this new edition, gives an update on the exciting results obtained thus far. His experiments look at how scientific research is often biased by experimenters&#x2019; expectations, such as the belief that physical constants cannot change. He also examines the taboo against taking pets seriously and explores the question of human extrasensory perception. Perhaps most important, he shows how simple yet radical research is already shaking the very foundations of science as we know it. <br> <br>In this compelling and intelligent book, Sheldrake offers no preconceived wisdom or easy answers--just an open invitation to explore the unknown, create new science, and perhaps even change the world. <br> <br>RUPERT SHELDRAKE, PH.D., is a former research fellow of the Royal Society and former director of studies in biochemistry and cell biology at Clare College, Cambridge University.

Some women never return home from their work place, a party or from walking to the corner. They are all young and poor and pretty. </p> <p>I have spent over ten years listening to women affected by Mexico&#x2019;s violence as I was interested in writing about women in Mexico&#x2019;s drug culture. This was a logical step for me after having written the novel <i>A True Story Based on Lies</i>, which is about the mistreatment of servants in Mexico. I interviewed the girlfriends, wives and daughters of drug traffickers and quickly came to realize that Mexico is a warren of hidden women. They hide in places that look like supermarkets or grocery stores on the outside, but that are really hiding places with false fa�ades; in the basements of convents, where women live with their children and have not seen daylight for years; and in privately-owned hotels that are rented by the government -- a surreal, Third World concept of a Witness Protection Program. </p> <p>In rural Mexico, the poorest families dig holes in their cornfields. This is how they hide their women from traffickers. It is as if they planted their daughters in the earth so they would not be stolen. </p> <p>At Mexico City&#x2019;s Santa Martha Acatitla Prison for women, I have listened to prisoners who have been deeply touched or have actively participated in the violence that Mexico is experiencing today. My conversations with assassins, drug dealers, women who claim to be innocent, and with famous criminals exposed cruel and tender lives. In that prison of rough, bare cement walls, I looked at drawings of shells, sand and blue fish drawn by a seventy-year-old woman who had sold fish tacos on a beach before she was forced by drug traffickers to carry drugs across the Mexican border into the United States. She told me that she liked to steal the prison&#x2019;s saltshakers and rub salt on her skin so she would not forget the sea. </p> <p>After listening to the women in hiding and the women in jail, as well as the women who have been victims of crime, the primary story for me became Mexico&#x2019;s missing women and children. </p> <p>For years I had heard or read: <i>she disappeared; she never came back; today she would be celebrating her sixteenth birthday; I am praying for a sign; she went missing; some men came for her; if I go to the police they laugh at me; she was just walking, just walking down the street; she never called back; she never called; I can see her walk through the door; that man knows where my daughter is; he took some other girls; I feel she&#x2019;s still alive; somebody sent someone for my daughter; someone sent somebody for my daughter. </i></p> <p>Although there are no exact statistics, the number of women trafficked in Mexico is very high. According to the U.S. State Department, 600,000 to 800,000 people are trafficked across international borders every year. (Note this estimate does not include those trafficked within national borders.) Most people who are stolen and sold are subjected to sex trafficking or other forms of modern slavery: forced labor, debt... </p> <p>A woman can be sold to different owners many times, and even dozens of times a day as a prostitute, while a plastic bag of drugs can be sold once. </p> <p><i> Prayers for the Stolen </i>is a novel about Ladydi Garcia Mart�nez. She is part of a community, like so many in rural Mexico, that has been decimated by drug traffickers, government agricultural policies and illegal immigration. Her home is a village near the once glamorous port of Acapulco. Her story, although inspired by truth, is fiction. </p><p>Jennifer Clement is the author of multiple books, including <i>Widow Basquiat</i>.

She was standing in a castle. She&#x2019;d sleep in a castle that night. An honest-to-God Irish castle in the heart of the west.</p><p>Some of her ancestors had worked there, probably slept there. Everything she knew verified that her people, on her mother&#x2019;s side in any case, had sprung from this gorgeous part of the world, this magical part of this magical country.</p><p>She&#x2019;d gambled, well, pretty much everything to come here, to find her roots, to&#x2014;she hoped&#x2014;connect with them. And most of all, to finally understand them.</p><p>Burnt bridges, left them smoldering behind her in the hopes of building new ones, stronger ones. Ones that led somewhere she wanted to go.</p><p>She&#x2019;d left her mother mildly annoyed. But then her mother never rose to serious anger, or sorrow, or joy or passion. How difficult had it been to find herself saddled with a daughter who rode emotions like a wild stallion? Her father had just patted her head in his absent way, and wished her luck as casually as he might some passing acquaintance.</p><p>She suspected she&#x2019;d never been any more than that to him. Her paternal grandparents considered the trip a grand adventure, and had given her the very welcome gift of a check.</p><p>She was grateful, even knowing they belonged to the out-of-sight-out-of-mind school and probably wouldn&#x2019;t give her another thought.</p><p>But her maternal grandmother, her treasured Nan, had given her a gift with so many questions.</p><p>She was here in this lovely corner of Mayo, ringed by water, shadowed by ancient trees, to find the answers.</p><p>She should wait until tomorrow, settle in, take a nap as she&#x2019;d barely slept on the flight from Baltimore. At least she should unpack. She had a week in Ashford Castle, a foolish expense on the practical scale. But she wanted, so wanted that connection, that once-in-a-lifetime treat.</p><p>She opened her bags, began to take out clothes.</p><p>She was a woman who&#x2019;d once wished she&#x2019;d grow taller than her scant five three, and curvier than the slim, teenage boy body the fates had granted her. Then she&#x2019;d stopped wishing and compensated by using bright colors in her wardrobe, and wearing high, high heels whenever she could manage it.</p><p>Illusion, Nan would say, was as good as reality.</p><p>She&#x2019;d once wished she could be beautiful, like her mother, but worked with what she had&#x2014;cute. The only time she&#x2019;d seen her mother close to genuinely horrified had been just the week before when Iona had chopped off her long blond hair to a pixie cap.</p><p>Far from used to it herself, she raked her fingers through it. It suited her, didn&#x2019;t it? Didn&#x2019;t it bring out her cheekbones a little?</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t matter if she regretted the impulse; she&#x2019;d regretted others. Trying new things, taking new risks&#x2014;those were her current goals. No more wait-and-see, the mantra of her parents as long as she could remember. Now was now.</p><p>And with that in mind she thought, the hell with unpacking, the hell with waiting until tomorrow. What if she died in her sleep?</p><p>She dug out boots, a scarf, the new raincoat&#x2014;candy pink&#x2014;she&#x2019;d bought for Ireland. She dragged a pink-and-white-striped cap over her hair, slung her oversized purse on cross-body.</p><p>Don&#x2019;t think, just do, she told herself, and left her warm, pretty room.</p><p>She made a wrong turn almost immediately, but it only gave her time to wander the corridors. She&#x2019;d asked for a room in the oldest section when she&#x2019;d booked, and liked to imagine servants scurrying with fresh rushes, or ladies sitting at their spindles. Or warriors in bloody mail returning from battle.</p><p>She had days to explore the castle, the grounds, the nearby village of Cong, and she meant to make use of all of it.</p><p>But her primary goal remained to seek out and make contact with the Dark Witch.</p><p>When she stepped outside into the whistling wind and drenching rain she told herself it was a perfect day for witches.</p><p>The little map Nan had drawn was in her bag, but she&#x2019;d etched it on her memory. She turned away from the great stone walls, took the path toward the deep woods. Passed winter-quiet gardens, spreads of soaked green. Belatedly she remembered the umbrella in her bag, dragged it out, pushing her way forward into the evocative gloom of the rain-struck woods.</p><p>She hadn&#x2019;t imagined the trees so big, with their wide, wide trunks, crazily gnarled branches. A storybook wood, she thought, thrilled with it even as the rain splashed over her boots.</p><p>Through its drumming she heard the wind sigh and moan, then the rumble of what must be the river.</p><p>Paths speared, forked, but she kept the map in her head.</p><p>She thought she heard something cry overhead, and for a moment imagined she saw the sweep of wings. Then despite the drumming, the rumbling, the sighs and the moans, everything suddenly seemed still. As the path narrowed, roughened, her heartbeat pounded in her ears, too quick, too loud.</p><p>To the right an upended tree exposed a base taller than a man, wider than her arm span. Vines thick as her wrist tangled together like a wall. She found herself drawn toward them, struck by the urge to pull at them, to fight her way through them to see what lay beyond. The concept of getting lost flitted through her mind, then out again.</p><p>She just wanted to see.</p><p>She took a step forward, then another. She smelled smoke and horses, and both pulled her closer to that tangled wall. Even as she reached out, something burst through. The massive black blur had her stumbling back. She thought, instinctively: Bear!</p><p>Since the umbrella had flown out of her hand, she looked around frantically for a weapon&#x2014;a stick, a rock&#x2014;then saw as it eyed her, the biggest dog ever to stand on four massive paws.</p><p>Not a bear, she thought, but as potentially deadly if he wasn&#x2019;t somebody&#x2019;s cheerful pet.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello . . . doggie.&#x201d;</p><p>He continued to watch her out of eyes more gold than brown. He stepped forward to sniff her, which she hoped wasn&#x2019;t the prelude to taking a good, hard bite. Then let out two cannon-shot barks before loping away.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; She bent over from the waist until she caught her breath. &#x201c;All right.&#x201d;</p><p>Exploring would definitely wait for a bright, sunny day. Or at least a brighter, dryer one. She picked up her soaked and muddy umbrella and pressed on.</p><p>She should&#x2019;ve waited on the whole thing, she told herself. Now she was wet and flustered and, she realized, more travel weary than she&#x2019;d expected. She should be napping in her warm hotel bed, snuggled in listening to the rain instead of trudging through it.</p><p>And now&#x2014;perfect&#x2014;fog rolled in, surfing over the ground like waves on the shore. Mists thickened like those vines, and the rain sounded like voices muttering.</p><p>Or there were voices muttering, she thought. In a language she shouldn&#x2019;t understand, but almost did. She quickened her pace, as anxious to get out of the woods as she&#x2019;d been to get into them.</p><p>The cold turned brutal until she saw her breath hazing out. Now the voices sounded in her head: Turn back. Turn back.</p><p>It was stubbornness as much as anxiety that had her pushing ahead until she nearly ran along the slippery path.</p><p>And like the dog, burst into the clear.</p><p>The rain was just the rain, the wind just the wind. The path opened into a road, with a few houses, smoke puffing out of chimneys. And beyond the beauty of the mist-shrouded hills.</p><p>&#x201c;Too much imagination, not enough sleep,&#x201d; she told herself.</p><p>She saw dooryard gardens resting their bright blooms for spring, cars parked on the roadside or in short drives.</p><p>Not far now, according to Nan&#x2019;s map, so she walked along the road, counting houses.</p><p>It sat farther off the road than the others, farther apart as if it needed breathing room. The pretty thatched-roofed cottage with its deep blue walls and bright red door transmitted that same storybook vibe&#x2014;yet a shiny silver Mini sat in the little driveway. The cottage itself jogged into an L, fronted by curved glass. Even in the winter, pots of bright pansies sat on the stoops, their exotic faces turned upward to drink in the rain.</p><p>A sign of aged wood hung above the curve of glass. Its deeply carved letters said:</p><p>The Dark Witch</p><p>&#x201c;I found her.&#x201d; For a moment Iona just stood in the rain, closed her eyes. Every decision she&#x2019;d made in the last six weeks&#x2014;perhaps every one she&#x2019;d made in her life&#x2014;had led to this.</p><p>She wasn&#x2019;t sure whether to go to the L&#x2014;the workshop, Nan had told her&#x2014;or the cottage entrance. But as she walked closer she saw the gleam of light on the glass. And closer still, the shelves holding bottles full of color&#x2014;bright or soft&#x2014;hanks of hanging herbs. Mortars and pestles, bowls and . . . cauldrons?</p><p>Steam puffed from one on a stove top, and a woman stood at a work counter, grinding something.</p><p>Iona&#x2019;s first thought was how unfair it seemed that some women could look like that even without fussing. The dark hair bundled up, sexily messy, the rosy flush from the work and the steam. The fine bones that said beauty from birth to death, and the deeply sculpted mouth just slightly curved in a contented smile.</p><p>Was it genes or magick? she wondered. But then, for some, one was the same as the other.</p><p>She gathered her courage and, setting her umbrella aside, reached for the door handle.</p><p>She barely touched it when the woman looked up, over. The smile deepened, polite welcome, so Iona opened the door, stepped in.</p><p>And the smile faded. Eyes of smoke gray held so intensely on her face that Iona stopped where she was, just over the threshold.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I come in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s in you are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I . . . I guess I am. I should&#x2019;ve knocked. I&#x2019;m sorry, I . . . God, it smells amazing in here. Rosemary and basil and lavender, and . . . everything. I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she said again. &#x201c;Are you Branna O&#x2019;Dwyer?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I am, yes.&#x201d; As she answered, she took a towel from under the counter, crossed to Iona. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re soaked through.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, sorry. I&#x2019;m dripping on the floor. I walked over from the castle. From the hotel. I&#x2019;m staying at Ashford Castle.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lucky you, it&#x2019;s a grand place.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like a dream, at least what I&#x2019;ve seen of it. I just got here. I mean, a couple hours ago, and I wanted to come to see you right away. I came to meet you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry, I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sorry for a lot it seems, in such a short time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ha.&#x201d; Iona twisted the towel in her hands. &#x201c;Yeah, it sounds like it. I&#x2019;m Iona. Iona Sheehan. We&#x2019;re cousins. I mean, my grandmother Mary Kate O&#x2019;Connor is cousins with your grandmother Ailish, um . . . Ailish Flannery. So that makes us . . . I get confused if it&#x2019;s fourth or third or whatever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A cousin&#x2019;s a cousin for all that. Well then, take off those muddy boots, and we&#x2019;ll have some tea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks. I know I should&#x2019;ve written or called or something. But I was afraid you&#x2019;d tell me not to come.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Were you?&#x201d; Branna murmured as she set the kettle on.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just once I&#x2019;d decided to come, I needed to push through with it.&#x201d; She left her muddy boots by the door, hung her coat on the peg. &#x201c;I always wanted to visit Ireland&#x2014;that roots thing&#x2014;but it was always eventually. Then . . . well, it was now. Right now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Go have a seat at the table back there, by the fire. It&#x2019;s a cold wind today.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;God, tell me! I swear it got colder the deeper I went into the woods, then . . . Oh Jesus, it&#x2019;s the bear!&#x201d;</p><p>She stopped as the massive dog lifted his head from his place at the little hearth, and gave her the same steady stare he had in the woods. &#x201c;I mean the dog. I thought he was a bear for a minute when he came bursting through the woods. But he&#x2019;s a really big dog. He&#x2019;s your dog.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s mine, yes, and I&#x2019;m his. He&#x2019;s Kathel, and he won&#x2019;t harm you. Have you a fear of dogs, cousin?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. But he&#x2019;s huge. What is he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Breeding, you mean. His father is an Irish wolfhound, and his mother a mix of Irish Dane and Scottish deerhound.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He looks fierce and dignified at the same time. Can I pet him?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That would be up to you and him,&#x201d; Branna said as she brought tea and sugar biscuits to the table. She said nothing more as Iona crouched, held out the back of her hand for the dog to sniff, then stroked it gently over his head.</p><p>&#x201c;Hello, Kathel. I didn&#x2019;t have time to introduce myself before. You scared the crap out of me.&#x201d;</p><p>She rose, smiled at Branna. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so happy to meet you, to be here. Everything&#x2019;s been so crazy, and it&#x2019;s all running around in my head. I can hardly believe I&#x2019;m standing here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sit then, and have your tea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I barely knew about you,&#x201d; Iona began as she sat, warmed her chilled hands on the cup. &#x201c;I mean, Nan had told me about the cousins. You and your brother.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Connor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Connor, and the others who live in Galway or Clare. She wanted to bring me over years ago, but it didn&#x2019;t work out. My parents&#x2014;well, mostly my mother&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t really want it, and she and my father split up, and then, well, you&#x2019;re just bouncing around between them. Then they both remarried, and that was weird because my mother insisted on an annulment. They say how that doesn&#x2019;t really make you a bastard, but it sure feels like it.&#x201d;</p><p>Branna barely lifted her eyebrows. &#x201c;I imagine it does, yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then there was school and work, and I was involved with someone for a while. One day I looked at him and thought, why? I mean we didn&#x2019;t have anything for each other but habit and convenience, and people need more, don&#x2019;t they?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d say they do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I want more, sometime anyway. Mostly, I never felt like I fit. Where I was, something always felt a little skewed, not quite right. Then I started having the dreams&#x2014;or I started remembering them, and I went to visit Nan. Everything she told me should&#x2019;ve sounded crazy. It shouldn&#x2019;t have made sense, but it did. It made everything make sense.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m babbling. I&#x2019;m so nervous.&#x201d; She picked up a cookie, stuffed it in her mouth. &#x201c;These are good. I&#x2019;m&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be saying you&#x2019;re sorry again. It&#x2019;s coming on pitiful. Tell me about the dreams.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He wants to kill me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Or I didn&#x2019;t. Nan says his name is&#x2014;was&#x2014;is Cabhan, and he&#x2019;s a sorcerer. Evil. Centuries ago our ancestor, the first dark witch, destroyed him. Except some part of him survived it. He still wants to kill me. Us. I know that sounds insane.&#x201d;</p><p>Placidly, Branna sipped her tea. &#x201c;Do I look shocked by all this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. You look really calm. I wish I could be really calm. And you&#x2019;re beautiful. I always wanted to be beautiful, too. And taller. You&#x2019;re taller. Babbling. Can&#x2019;t stop it.&#x201d;</p><p>Rising, Branna opened a cupboard, took out a bottle of whiskey. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a good day for a little whiskey in your tea. So you heard this story about Cabhan and Sorcha, the first dark witch, and decided to come to Ireland to meet me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Basically. I quit my job, I sold my stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You . . .&#x201d; For the first time Branna looked genuinely surprised. &#x201c;You sold your things?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Including twenty-eight pairs...</p></p><h2>Three Women</h2><p>Three murder romances in one volume follow Nialla Dunn, as she eludes her father&#39;s killer; Carla Murdock, as she completes her father&#39;s unfinished mission in the name of military intelligence and love; and Irene Teasey, as she fights for her property in the New World</p><p></p>
